Cape Town - Recently youngsters have gone viral for doing their very own South African haka.

The words of a haka often poetically describe ancestors and events in the tribe's history.

 
  
 
 
  The haka is still used during Māori ceremonies and celebrations to honour guests and show the importance of the occasion in New Zealand, but have gained a lot of prominence due to its use
   to challenge opponents on the sports field.
