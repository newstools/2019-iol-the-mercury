It's been a month since they tied the knot in a lavish traditional wedding ceremony now one of Mzansi's favourite couples are celebrating that small milestone. 
 

 Mohale and Somizi celebrated their one month anniversary this week with Mohale surprising Somizi with a stay at The Houghton Hotel's Rockstar Penthouse. 

 

 The penthouse, which is 830 sqm, costs R68 000 a night and includes Montblanc gifts, silk pajamas from Top Drawer Collection, a private wine selection, champagne on arrival, a 24 hour butler service and more. 

 

 Mohale, who was already in the penthouse when Somizi arrived had set out a cake and champagne. Somizi, who screamed when he saw Mohale said, "I have been having such a bad day. You have made my day. Thank you, baby". 

 

 Mohale then tells Somizi that they will be staying over for the night and takes him on a tour of the penthouse, showing him the bar, formal dining room, lounge and balcony. 

 

 Somizi took to social media to post a video of the surprise.
