Anele Mdoda landed in hot water over the weekend when she said Kelly Rowland doesn't look good without make-up.Â 
 This all began when Sizwe Dhlomo tweeted: "Kelly Rowland could lowkey be the best looking one in DC."

 Anele then quote tweeted him in a now deleted tweet and said: "Kelly looks amazing with make-up. Take that make-up off, then it's tickets. I have receipts".Â

 Followed by a collage picture of the "Motivation" singer with and without make-up.Â

 South African tweeps were confused by both the comment and the "receipts" since Kelly looked good in both pictures.

 




Whatever emotion youâ€™re projecting please put it back into the dark closet. Kelly Rowland is a beautiful woman. Thereâ€™s no need for this.

Mzansi then started dragging her for her comments and also started insulting her for her looks.Â

 However, it wasn't until American Twitter got a hold of her comments that things started heating up.Â

 Local tweeps also started distancing themselves from Anele's comments as they saw her being dragged.Â

 On Monday, Phat Joe also threw in a bit of indirect shade during his "Phat Joe and The Family" radio show when he asked "have you ever been criticised by someone below your level?", which Mzansi found hilarious.Â

 In case you missed it, Phat Joe and Anele were caught in a public spat after he questioned why she was a judge on Miss SA, to which AneleÂ labelled him a piece of sh*t for his comments.Â 
 Phat Joe did eventuallyÂ apologise for his comments via a private phone call, but it seems he couldn't miss this opportunityÂ to throw a little shade Anele's way.
