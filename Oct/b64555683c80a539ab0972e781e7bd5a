OPINION - As chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, we welcome the Health Market Inquiry (HMI) report into the private sector, headed by Justice Sandile Ngcobo.
Some of the findings in the HMI report indicate that government has failed in its duty to regulate the private health sector.

The HMI was launched in January 2014 to investigate the high prices and uncompetitive nature of the private healthcare industry. The inquiry was set to be completed within a year. The report was published on Monday.
The committee needs to study the report and the recommendations in order to see how we can be able to contribute towards the transformation of the health sector in our country.
Therefore we need to have a new debate that says both private and public health sectors have got challenges as things stand, as a result we need to transform and get a new order in the healthcare delivery of the country.

The messages that have been in the public domain that say, just fix the public hospitals and leave the private sector, do not hold water. We need to say while we would urge government to fix public hospitals and clinics, there is a role that the private health sector can play to clean its house.
Issues of regulation, over pricing, no competition and overtreating are causing extraneous escalation for healthcare in the country and these need to be addressed by government.
