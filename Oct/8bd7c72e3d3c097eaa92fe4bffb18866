Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) has launched a graduate support and placement programme that will benefit young, unemployed graduates.
Cogta MEC Sipho Hlomuka said more than 500 young people would be recruited and trained for 24 months in various fields that were in demand by the local government sector.

He said the graduates would then be placed in various municipalities across the province as part of a capacity-building programme.
“The task of repositioning the sphere of local government in the province is going full steam ahead,” said Hlomuka.
Cogta issued an advert inviting unemployed graduates to apply. They must have successfully completed a three- or four-year qualification in any of the following fields: civil engineering, construction and build management, internal audit and risk management, urban and regional planning, finance and accounting, electrical engineering, water engineering and quality management, plumbing and sanitation, GIS and land use and human resources management.

Hlomuka said the assessment that the department conducted of municipalities found there was a need for specialised skills, especially in engineering, finance, town planning and human resources.
“We therefore took a decision to embark on this groundbreaking project where we will recruit young people with the aim of sending them to our municipalities, where they will harness their skills and improve the level of service delivery,” said Hlomuka. 
Applications opened last week and close on October 11.
