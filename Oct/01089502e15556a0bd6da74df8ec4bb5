Johannesburg - EFF Leader Julius Malema paid a warm tribute to former DA leader Mmusi Maimane, who on Thursday dumped the party after resigning as leader on Wednesday.  
Maimane announced his decision to leave the DA entirely on Thursday morning. He had initially sought to stay on as the party’s parliamentary leader until December. 

“I have worked tirelessly to build the project of One SA for All. It’s been my greatest honour to serve the people of SA and will continue to do so. I have today resigned from the DA and Parliament. Thank you to the people of this country for your faith in our nation. God bless SA,” tweeted Maimane.

Maimane, Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and former Nelson Mandela Mayor Atholl Trollip all left the DA this week after former DA leader Helen Zille emerged as James Selfe successor as the party's federal council and federal executive chairperson on Sunday. 
 

 The DA currently remains currently leaderless as it sought legal advise about whom to instill as interim leader as both the party and chairperson left the party, creating a leadership vacuum. 

 

 Malema described Maimane as a ‘good human being’ and said he should not be discouraged. “I'm not home but when I come back we should have lenakana la monna wa mosepidi. You are a good human being, don't be discouraged, my big brother,” tweeted Malema.

  "Dear 
  @MmusiMaimane
  , When we spoke briefly 3 weeks ago I quoted Ecclesiastes 10:4 'If a rulers anger rises against you do not leave your post; calmness can lay great offenses to rest'. That post is your convictions. Remain true to them! My Brother, I wish you well for the future," he tweeted.
