Social media users have been brutal in their criticism of ANC stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete's Al Jazeera interview, branding it "embarrassing", "painful" and "a reflection of South Africa's political leadership".
 

 Mbete was interviewed by Head to Head host Mehdi Hasan and was joined on set by former ANC politician Makhosi Khoza, who resigned from the party in 2017 after calling for then-president Jacob Zuma to step down; former politician and now Watch UK director and author Andrew Feinstein;Â  and ANC memberÂ 
 Xolani Xala, the founder of South African Business Abroad and member of the ANC.

 

 During the hard-hitting interview Mbete defended the multi-million rand Nkandla upgrade, refused to accept that the ANC was to blame for state capture, claimed that crime was brought to South Africa by colonialists and insisted that she didn't know anything about who would be held accountable for the Marikana massacre.

 

 Here are some of the reactions on Twitter.

 



We are outraged and talking too much because Baleka Mbete's performance was in front of the world and, is a reflection of South Africa's political leadership.

Unless @MbeteBaleka insisted on that interview with @mehdirhasan she should fire her whole team! That interview did not do her any favours. If you saw Baleka Mbete TownHall with @KarimaBrown in 2017 you would know why she should have NOT done that interview

The facts are nothing new. But when @mehdirhasan lays them out, #BalekaMbete is exposed as a shameless sell-out. @MYANC can stop pretending #StateCapture was a surprise. This schizophrenic game of being victim, perpetrator & saviour is quite tiresome. https://t.co/7TAubxsZ9a

Baleka Mbete goes all the way to UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ to say she will find out about Marikana murderers.What is it for her to find out when she really knows that no one was jailed for murder. #AljazeeraInterview

Baleka Mbete should've turned that embarrassing interview down. Just when we thought we had recovered from 2016 Maite Nkoana-Mashabane's Al Jazeera equally embarrassing interview, boom, Baleka outshines her.

Baleka Mbete should be burned from doing any media interviews. She is embarrassing, this shows how our politicians are, she thought it's our paid journalist that giggle with you when they interview. This is how our journalist should be conducting interviews #BalekaMbete #ANC pic.twitter.com/hP4uzr4bkb

If you didn't vote for the party of which Baleka Mbete is a senior representative, then you don't have to feel embarrassed. If you did, you do.
