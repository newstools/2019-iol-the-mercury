Johannesburg - Former Western Cape premier Helen Zille's election as the chair of the DA's Federal Council has brought some humour to social media with a trending hashtag #ClearlyBetterThanZille.
 

 Zille was elected at the weekend and her comeback into politics has received mixed reactions politically and in society. The hashtag #ClearlyBetterThanZille is being used as a humorous attempt at breaking the ice.

 

 Social media users are posting pictures of things that could be described as being better than Zille. The humour serves as a reminder of how controversial a political figure Zille has become over the years.

 

 She ended her premiership earlier this year following the 2019 general elections. She had also previously served as the leader of the DA.
