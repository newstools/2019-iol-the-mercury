Durban - Residents of Nkangala, at Adams Mission, south of Durban say they have not had running tap water for more than 12 years.
Residents said they had been without running water since 2007. 

One of the residents, who did not want to be named, said it was difficult having to rely on municipal water tankers and JoJo tanks for water.
“Some of us are old and we can’t be running after the water tanker to get water. The tankers do come but sometimes they come after three days. Some were given JoJo tanks but the water is often not clean and makes children sick,” said a resident. 
DA PR councillor for the area Zandile Mkhize said the party in eThekwini had written to eThekwini Municipality’s head of Water and Sanitation, Ednick Msweli, asking for urgent intervention.

“The only answer we got was that there isn’t enough water supply,” said Mkhize. 
EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said their investigations showed that the water demand in the area was exceeding the available supply. 
Mayisela said that the city was looking at ways to address the challenges. 

“Plans include educating residents to report burst pipes immediately, and also that they should report illegal water connections and to use water wisely,” said Mayisela.
