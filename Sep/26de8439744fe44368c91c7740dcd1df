Durban - AN SAPS officer was shot dead allegedly by his girlfriend at the weekend in KwaDabeka, west of Durban.
It is alleged that Siyabonga Charles Sokhela was shot by his Durban metro police girlfriend at his house.

KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the incident happened in the early hours of yesterday.
She said the 29-year-old officer was taken to hospital where he was certified dead on arrival.
“A case of murder was opened at KwaDabeka police station for investigation and a 28-year-old suspect was immediately arrested,” Mbele said.

Sokhela was the father of three children - a 9-year-old, 5-year-old, and an 18-month-old baby. Sokhela’s mother Thandazile Tembe said the incident had left her heartbroken. 
An emotional Tembe said Sokhela was her eldest child and had been looking after the family. 
She said that her son was a down to earth person who was very respectful. 

“He was the one who was doing everything in this family. We really don’t know what we are going to do,” Sokhela said. 
Local ward councillor Mandla Mbambo said the community was very disturbed by the murder.
“It is very tense in the area and everyone is now worried about what happened,” Mbambo said.

The woman was expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court today.
