 "We endorse the decision to suspend the teacher concerned and then immediately institute disciplinary hearings on the basis of the court appearance and the information we'll receive at court as well
"The school has already amplified its school arrangements. One they've appointed a security firm to ensure everyone's safe. Secondly and this is very, very important they [installed] CCTV cameras so that the safety of all our learners can be assured."

Lesufi confirmed that following a meeting between the school and parents, De Jager's parents indicated that the child would return to the school and even thanked the school for the support during the ordeal. 
The suspects are in police custody and are expected to appear in court on Friday morning.
