Durban - The eThekwini Municipality is confident that the Mobeni Heights Crematorium will be up and running again by December.
Speaking during a media briefing at the 2nd Pan African Cemeteries and Crematoria Conference, parks, recreation and culture head Thembinkosi Ngcobo admitted the crematorium was not operational. 

“I know that we have been promising that it would be ready. We previously said it would be ready in two months time but that was the information that I was given. The necessary equipment was on its way from the United States but it has not arrived. There have been so many complications. Maybe we should not be promising anymore,” he said. 
Ngcobo said the non-operational crematorium was a serious issue. 
EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said: “When the cremator arrives at the Durban port we will move with speed to have it installed. We are confident that the cremator will be operational before Christmas.

“We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this is causing to our residents. We are appealing to them to bear with us and use other crematoriums.”
The furnace at the crematorium broke down in 2016 and again in 2018. The Clare Estate Crematorium has been accommodating cremations for families due to the furnace breakdown at Mobeni.
