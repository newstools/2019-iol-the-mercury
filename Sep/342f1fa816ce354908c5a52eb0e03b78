Durban - One year after her son's body was found in a shallow grave in Phoenix, Raylene Louw, wept as she planted a tree at his school on Tuesday afternoon. 
A small group of family and friends gathered at Rippon Road Primary School in Sydenham where they planted a tree in memory of Miguel Louw. 

Miguel's story gripped the hearts of communities across the country after he was allegedly kidnapped by a man known to the family in July last year. 
Two months later, the youngster's partially decomposed body was found buried in a shallow grave, mere metres away from the home of the man who allegedly kidnapped him.
