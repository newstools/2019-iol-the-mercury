Durban - Admiral the tortoise, Durban’s living legend and the country’s oldest tortoise Admiral turned 109 years on Tuesday.
eThekwini Municipality and residents celebrated 109 years of his life with a fitting birthday celebration and gifts in the form of fruits and vegetables.

 The country’s oldest citizen arrived in Durban in 1915, after he was dropped off at what is now known as the Mitchell Park Zoo, in cigarette box by a naval officer who was leaving for the World War I but he never came back.

The Giant Aldabra tortoise is the last survivor of three that were left. They were brought from the Aldabra Islands. 
In 2001, the one surviving male was named Admiral and made an honorary member of the Durban naval base. 

Admiral weighs close to 300kg.
