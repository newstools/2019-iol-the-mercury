Durban - More than 300 people will be permanently employed by the eThekwini Municipality to collect waste in the uMlazi area.
This is according to the newly appointed chairperson of Human Settlements in the municipality, Thanduxolo Sabela, who said that the posts will be advertised in the next three weeks.

“The posts are for people who will be working in the uMlazi area only. I have met with the officials and we have agreed that they will be advertised within three weeks,” said Sabela.
Sabela was speaking at the launch of the Clean and Maintain my Township programme in uMlazi yesterday. During the launch, the municipality’s officials together with members of Parliament collected waste in the area and also listened to the community’s concerns. 
Longer-term maintenance issues such as repairing leaks, fixing potholes and the cutting of grass were also identified. 

In June, eThekwini councillors unanimously agreed to do away with the outsourcing of waste collection contracts in Umlazi.
