Durban - FOR many whose companies are on Maydon Wharf, a walk near the M4 bridge can have disastrous results, as robbers were waiting for their next victim. 
 

 An employee from a freight company, who asked not to be named, said crime was out of hand, adding that it was not safe for anyone to travel to work.
“There’s about 30000 people employed in this port that have to use the arterial roads, either on foot or in a car, and none of us are safe,” she said.

She said, at the company she works for, there were cases of robberies, assaults, smash-and-grabs and stabbings.

“It costs us almost R200 000 a month to take our people from the company to the market and back, so that they don’t have to catch a taxi there,” she said.

A security guard, who refused to be named, said he used the train to get to work, and was afraid to travel in the morning because of safety concerns.

“I was walking with a group of people, at 5am last week, and we saw a man who had a gunshot wound in his leg, asking for help,” the guard said.

Unilever, which also has a factory in the area, said they had introduced a patrol vehicle and staff transport, from the CBD to Maydon Wharf, to ensure the safety of employees. Karen Singh
