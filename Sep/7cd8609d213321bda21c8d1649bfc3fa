Dirban - Sibusiso Mpungose, the Wyebank man accused of killing his four children on Tuesday, abandoned his bail application at the Pinetown Magistrate's Court where he made his first appearance on Friday morning. 
The 44-year-old looked numb as he stood in the dock in black pants and a grey top, his head head down. He spoke quietly. 

Mpungose alleged picked up three of the children, Sphesihle, 10, Khwezi, 6, and Kuhlekonke Mpungose, 4, from school on Tuesday, before hanging the children in the family home. The children were still in their school uniforms and were found hanging by their belts. 
He then allegedly picked up his wife's oldest daughter Ayakha Jiyane, 16, from Pinetown Girl's High School. She was allegedly strangled with a bathrobe belt and found in the bush in Padfield Park, Pinetown.
Mpungose allegedly called Ayakha's biological father and told him to come and collect his "parcel" from where her body was found.

He was arrested while allegedly trying to take his own life.
The children's mother Xoli Mpungose was not at court, but the accused's family was there in numbers.
Before proceedings started a group of women held a protest and sang songs against gender-based violence outside the court.

The case was remanded until October 9 for further investigation.
