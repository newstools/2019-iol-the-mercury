A missing person's docket has been opened at the Umbilo police station and investigating officers are pleading for anyone who might have information about Conabeer’s disappearance to come forward.
Conabeer’s disappearance comes as the country is reeling from a spate rapes, abductions and killings of women and children, in the past two weeks. These issues were put into the spotlight following the brutal rape and murder of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana at a Cape Town post office.
