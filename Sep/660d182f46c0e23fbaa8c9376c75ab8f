Durban - eThekwini Municipal mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda, has praised police officers following a shootout in Isipingo that left nine members of an armed gang dead. 
Kaunda said such operations will restore business confidence in eThekwini Municipality. 

During his inaugural speech, Kaunda raised a concern about the scourge of crime in the inner city and secondary towns such as Pinetown, Isipingo and Verulam.
“The levels of crime in these areas have forced some businesses to close shops and migrate to other parts of the province. As the municipality, we are going to work closely with the police to ensure that all crime hotspots within the municipality are monitored. The Metro Police, working with the SAPS will continue to intensify law enforcement in these areas to eradicate crime,” said Kaunda.
He said that he will continue to engage with the senior management of the police within the city to ensure that similar operations are conducted in other crime infested areas. The crime statistics released by the SAPS last week do not paint a good picture about the crime situation in the city. 

“Therefore, we are going to ensure that our integrated law enforcement plans zoom into the areas that have recorded increase in house and business robberies as well as murder.” said Kaunda.
