Durban - Police have vowed to step up crime fighting efforts in Isipingo after a noted increase of crime in suburbs in recent weeks. 
Provincial SAPS spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said visible policing members are deployed in the area on a 24-hour basis to curb criminals activities. 

"They will also be joined by police officers from the police stations within the eThekwini Outer South Cluster who will be using quad bikes to patrol the area," she said. 
Isipingo community policing forum (CPF) chairperson Aiden David said they had noted an increase in petty crime and muggings in suburbs.
He said they have had a challenge with people using the bushy area along the railway lines to lie in wait for their next victim. 

"Residents are being mugged of their cellphones and personal belongings," he said.
David said this is a result of criminals being squeezed out of the CBD, with the number of clean-up operations undertaken by police and eThekwini Municipality. 
In recent months, the city has stepped up clean up operations of the Isipingo CBD. Last month, two scrapyards were raided. 

According to the eThekwini municipality the businesses were contravening Section 77 of the Town Planning Ordinance, Section 76 of the Planning and Land Use Management By-Law 2016 and Section 4 of the National Building Regulations.
