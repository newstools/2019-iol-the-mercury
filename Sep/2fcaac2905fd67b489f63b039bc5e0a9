In a moving message on his Facebook page last week, Padayachee’s brother Woshen Padayachee, called for his sister’s death not to be in vain.
“No one human being should be able to hold your life hostage, dear ladies be as strong as my sister Verusha Padayachee, don’t let her murder be in vain,” he said. 

“Let our loss be a lesson to stand up for yourself, not because you are not afraid, but because God gave you this life, enjoy it and never live like a hostage. My sister died free, she lived her last weeks on her terms,” said the post.
“I never understood the value of a true woman until I lost you my sister, no words can express the anguish of finding you laying there, but know that your fight to the end was not in vain,” he said.
The police said any person who could help the investigation should contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111.
