Durban - A Durban man has been hailed as a good Samaritan after he saved a toddler from a vehicle that crashed into a residential swimming pool in Pinetown, on Thursday afternoon. 
Andreas Mathios, spokesperson from Blue Security, said Ntuthuko Buthelezi had heard the sound of a vehicle crashing into the wall of a neighbouring property and rushed out to investigate.

"When he got to the scene he found that the SUV had crashed through a wall and landed in the swimming pool."
Mathios said the vehicle was almost fully submerged in the pool.
