Durban - KwaZulu-Natal police have confirmed the arrest of a 20-year-old man in connection with the murder of Sinethemba Ndlovu, who was stabbed to death at a car-spinning event in Msinga, northern KwaZulu-Natal, on Saturday.
Ndlovu, a University of Kwa­Zulu-Natal student, sustained two stab wounds, one below the left armpit and another to the stomach. 

She died on Monday in hospital.
According to KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala, the suspect was arrested on Tuesday in Msinga and will appear in court soon. 
Ndlovu’s sister, Sinenhlanhla Ndlovu, said the family was saddened by her sister’s death.

“It would be better if she died after being sick. She has gone suddenly without us saying goodbye.” 
She described her sister as a person who loved modelling, cooking and trying new things in life.
“Everyone at home knows that she was a person who liked to try everything,” she said. 

“When she was returning from the car-spinning event with her friends, a group of men tried to touch them inappropriately, and when my sister objected, they stabbed her,” said Ndlovu. “In the morning a nurse called to inform us that she had died.”
