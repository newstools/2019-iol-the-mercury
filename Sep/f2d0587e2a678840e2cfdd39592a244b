Durban - The family of a 13-year-old schoolgirl has pleaded with law enforcement authorities to play their role after their daughter was allegedly raped by a teacher at a school in Mkhindini Reserve in Melmoth, near Eshowe.
It was alleged a 51-year-old teacher had a sexual relationship with the girl from February until this month.

She fell pregnant and informed the suspect of pains she was experiencing.
The suspect allegedly gave the victim tablets, saying they were for pain relief. She took ill and was taken to hospital, where it was discovered the tablets were for the termination of her pregnancy.
KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a suspect was in custody after his arrest on Friday. The man appeared in the Melmoth Magistrate’s Court On Thursday.

KwaZulu-Natal Education Department spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said the department’s position was clear that teachers were prohibited from having sexual relations with pupils.
KZN MEC for Social Development, Nonhlanhla Khoza has condemned the incident.
She said members of the public had a responsibility to ensure that such heinous incidents don’t occur in schools and communities.

A family member said: “I hope that the law plays its role so that other teachers who molest children will learn a lesson.”
