Durban - It’s estimated that at least two thirds of children with cancer, including teens, never reach a specialist treatment centre and that the majority of those that do, are unfortunately in the advanced stages of their illness.
Cancers affecting younger people share general symptoms with other illnesses, which can result in a misdiagnosis and there needs to be a determined effort by government to educate parents, medical and clinic staff to be aware of symptoms.

In teens especially, the warning signs of cancer may be attributed to growing pains associated with this developmental stage, or with normal sports injuries as teens tend to be active.
The cause of most cancers affecting teens is not known. Current international data suggests 10% of teens diagnosed, may have a genetic predisposition to it and those with HIV are at higher risk for certain cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
The top cancers currently affecting teens are non-Hodgkins, Hodgkins lymphomas, bone and soft tissue cancers (sarcomas), brain tumours, Kaposi sarcoma and leukaemia. 

Parents and guardians need to be alert to symptoms that persist or recur repeatedly, as medical assistance should then be sought immediately.
