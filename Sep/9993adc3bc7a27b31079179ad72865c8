DURBAN - Nine Durban University of Technology students, including SRC President Thamsanqa Memela, appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court earlier today on charges of attempted murder and public violence which incorporates assault, arson and malicious damage to property.
This followed a protest by students on Wednesday morning over security issues on campus. But the protest soon turned violent, with the campus descending into chaos and students allegedly attacking a security guard, pouring petrol over him and attempting to set him alight. This was after security guard houses were set alight. 

Appearing before Magistrate Vanitha Armu yesterday were Memela, Solatho Dlamini, Thabiso Mathenjwa, Luzuko Stali, Thobani Khanyeza, Mluleki Mkhize, Thabo Mkhwelanga, Sinqobile Myeni and Jula Sinqobele. 
The court was crowded with supporting students, some wearing EFF shirts and berets. 
Bail was set at R2000 for each of the accused and they are due to appear again on December 4. 

Earlier in the week, Provincial SAPS spokesperson Jay Naicker said the injured guard was rescued by his colleagues who witnessed the attack.

“He sustained severe injuries and was sent to hospital for medical attention,” said Naicker.
