Durban - Various reports on social media about protest action currently taking place in the Durban CBD is not true. 
 

 Durban metro spokesperson Parboo Sewpersadh confirmed that the videos and messages circulating about shops being looted was fake news. 

 

 Sewpersadh attributed this to possible circulation of old videos, and said there was no threat to any persons, buildings or businesses today in the CBD area.  

 

 "Everything is normal. 
 A scheduled march is currently taking place in West Street with about 50 people only. 

 

 "It has reached the finishing point at the City Hall and people have actually started dispersing," said Sewpersadh. 

 

 He added that at no point was the march volatile. 

 

 "Police have been monitoring the march from start to finish and everything went smoothly."

 

 Sewpersad cautioned people to stop sharing fake messages on social media, without verifying it first and causing undue panic among residents and communities in Durban.
