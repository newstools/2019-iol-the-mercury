Durban - Tertiary institutions were for teaching and learning, and not for criminality and lawlessness.
The Minister of Higher Education, Science, and Technology, Dr Blade Nzimande, said this after Durban University of Technology (DUT) student Sandile Ndlovu died on Saturday morning. 

First-year Industrial Engineering student Ndlovu, 18, was stabbed in a lecture hall at DUT’s Steve Biko campus two weeks ago.
Nzimande said he was deeply saddened by Ndlovu’s death and conveyed his condolences to his family, friends and fellow students. 
Nzimande further welcomed the suspension of the head of security at the university who had the responsibility to ensure that there were proper security measures in place.

Nzimande has directed the DUT Council to ensure that the university management gives the Ndlovu family the necessary care and support. 
Meanwhile, nine DUT students who were arrested last week on a charge of attempted murder were released on R2000 bail each on Friday.
They were arrested after allegedly trying to set alight a security guard at DUT’s Steve Biko campus.
