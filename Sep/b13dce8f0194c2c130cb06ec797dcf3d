Durban - UMALUSI Council has announced plans to phase out the National Senior Certificate (NSC) Colleges within the next year.
The qualifications authority said no registration would be allowed from January 2021.

The NSC qualification was offered at mainly private colleges under the auspices of Umalusi as a quality council. It is also known informally as a Technical Matric.
It services mainly private colleges for N3 students who want to upgrade their qualification to a matric equivalent. 
Umalusi said it had taken the decision following research that found the NSC was not popular.

“Umalusi does not have the exact numbers but the uptake is very low,” said Umalusi spokesperson Lucky Ditaunyane. 
“An analysis conducted by Umalusi Council in 2016 indicated that very few candidates elect to be certified for the qualification and that the NSC (Colleges) qualification does not articulate meaningfully with other qualifications on the National Qualifications Framework,” he said. 
Umalusi said the last date of examinations for students requiring the two N3 Business Languages to qualify for the NSC (Colleges) and for the National Technical Certificate N3 subjects to qualify for the Senior Certificate would be November 2020. No further registration would be allowed from January 1, 2021.
