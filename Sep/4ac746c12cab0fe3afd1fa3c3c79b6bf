Durban - Six days of ongoing violent clashes between Steadville residents and the police culminated in the arrest of 20 people for public violence.
Residents of the Ladysmith town went on the rampage last week demanding that the government fix their homes that were damaged during a freak storm in 2012. 

Yesterday, officers from SAPS Public Order Policing, Tactical Response and various other units, were deployed to the area after residents lined roads with rocks and stones. Officers also came under attack from the mob. It is believed that residents burnt a municipal vehicle and a grader that had been hired to clear the roads.
Several homes were destroyed during a hailstorm in Ladysmith and neighbouring Estcourt in December 2012. At least 500 homes were damaged 
Residents were promised that their homes would be repaired, but according to them only eight out of 35 homes had been repaired. 

A Steadville resident, who refused to be named, said residents were also angry that locals had not been employed to help rebuild the damaged homes. 
He said they felt that it was unfair as several people living in the community were unemployed.
Alfred Duma municipality spokesperson Siyabonga Maphalala said they were trying to get the situation under control, saying residents believed that the contractors were not working fast enough. 

Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that 20 people had been arrested and were due to appear in the Ladysmith Magistrateâ€™s Court today.
