Thirty-five-year-old Zuma, who is the twin of embattled Duduzane Zuma, retweeted and liked tweets that supported her comment.Â 
Many celebrated the Springboks' victory over the English team on Saturday, saying the match was 'nation-building' and unified the country. However, Zuma disagrees.

In a separate tweet, she said there will never be a united South Africa, adding that Archbishop Desmond Tutu "played the black people" with the idea of a Rainbow nation.
