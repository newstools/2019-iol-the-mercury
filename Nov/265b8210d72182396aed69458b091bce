They have said that they were unsure of the details around the murders. 
Muhammad's family told reporters that they had last heard from her at around lunch time. She told them that she was going to Suncoast for lunch. 
Provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said two cases of murder were opened at the Durban Central police station. 

Police have also asked members of the public to refrain from sharing the gruesome photographs of the two people. 
Suncoast communications manager, Kelly Graham, said the area is highly policed by both metro police and SAPS. 
"The area is highly policed by SAPS, Metro and other security agencies that patrol the promenade. Suncoast will continue to collaborate and support the Festive Season management plan as laid out by FESMAC and Metro," she said.
