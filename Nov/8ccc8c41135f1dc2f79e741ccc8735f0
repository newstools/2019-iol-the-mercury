Durban - The M4 north between Sibaya and uMhlanga is expected to be closed for at least four weeks.
The stretch of road was closed on Sunday after a portion of the roadway and side of the road was washed away in a mudslide caused by heavy rains. 

Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said the provincial Transport Department was responsible for repairing the road and it was hoped that it would be fixed before the start of the festive season.
Sewpersad advised motorists, who have been frustrated by the road closure due to the extra travel time added to trips, to leave earlier to accommodate unforeseen delays.

 
 
  The M4 between uMhlanga and Sibaya has been closed until further notice by the metro police due to the side of the road being washed away in a mudslide caused by heavy rain. 
 

He added that there was more than one alternative route that motorists could use, including the M41, N2, R102 and Umhlanga Rocks Drive.
Provincial Transport Department spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane told The Mercury yesterday that a team from the department had been working on the issue. 
Ncalane said that inspectors visited the area with officials from eThekwini Municipality because some of the affected infrastructure and repairs would fall under the municipality. 

“Once the team is done they will furnish us with a detailed report. 
“The report will highlight the extent of the damage, how long it will take to fix and how much it will cost. 
“The team is working as we speak, and by tomorrow (today) they should provide the first technical report,” said Ncalane. 

He added that the department wanted the matter to be addressed urgently, considering the impact to motorists and the road network, as the M4 north provided a strategic link to uMhlanga and King Shaka International Airport.
