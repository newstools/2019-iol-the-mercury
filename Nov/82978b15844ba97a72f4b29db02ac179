Durban - The body of a toddler was found floating in a stream in Sundumbili on Sunday afternoon. 
According to IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, Paul Herbst, they were called out to assist in searching for a 21-month old boy who had gone missing. 

"It was reported that the young boy, together with other children, had gone to tend to cattle in a nearby kraal. When returning, the young boy got separated from the group," Herbst said. 
He said concerned family members alerted authorities once they could not find the young child. 
"IPSS Medical Rescue together with SAPS K9 Search & Rescue started searching shortly after the other boys were interviewed. The search continued throughout the storm with K9 Dante picking up a scent, approximately 200m from the homestead," Herbst said. 


 




He said the boy's body was found floating in a stream. 

The boy's body was handed over to police and an inquest was opened. Police are investigating further. 
Earlier in the day, the team responded to a crash between a minibus taxi and a light delivery vehicle on the M27 between Waterloo and uMdloti. Two people were killed in the crash.
Herbst said five people had been ejected from both vehicles. 

"Sadly, two people sustained fatal injuries and were declared dead at the scene. Multiple other occupants sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate.Once treated and stabilised at the scene, the patients were rushed to various hospitals for further care," he said.
