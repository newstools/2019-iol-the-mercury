Cape Town - The lovefest for Springbok scrumhalf Faf de Klerk continues as the team goes on their victory tour across the country.

 

 With every appearance, De Klerk solidifies himself as the '"chaotic'' but endearing boyfriend that SA rugby fans cannot get enough of.

 

 
  
   Many South Africans were tuning in to watch the Rugby World Cup, and couldn't help but notice De Klerk more frequently. He first went viral 
   during the semi-final with Wales, when he was in a "David and Goliath" clash with Wales lock, Jake Ball.
  
 
  
 
 
  The 1.72m tall De Klerk lived up to his nickname as "Giant Slayer" as he smirked at the 1.97m tall Ball without a hint of fear.
 
 
  
 
 
  Then he went viral again after pictures and video of him in his speedo hand tongues
   wagging on social media.
 
 
  
   
   
    The internet could not enough of the lovable, and 'chaotic' Faf de Klerk after pictures and video of him in his speedo went viral all over social media. Picture: Rugby World Cup/Twitter
   
  
 
 
  The images were snapped from within the locker room after the Springboks had defeated England 32-12 in the Rugby World Cup final.
 
 
  
 
 
  His cheeky antics brought a smile to many on social media, and had many calling his energy, chaotic.
 

 

 Once this was unanimously accepted by social media, there was no going back. On Thursday, everyone couldn't get enough of him while he was with the team and greeting fans along the Springbok's victory tour:

Faf De Klerk has the energy of a toddler. Chaotic. Messy. All over the place. Highly entertaining. 😂

Now here's a bit of irresistible cuteness. This young man has obviously found a hero in Francois 'Faf' de Klerk, and knows his every move.I thought it would add to the appeal to edit some real Faf footage into his backyard test match, during which he won the world cup. pic.twitter.com/Yp1egDaD8w
