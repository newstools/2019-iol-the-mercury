According to acting city spokesperson, Mandla Nsele,the potential impact of the severe thunderstorms with heavy downpours could result in roads being flooded. 

"Flooding of settlements, both formal and informal, as well as the closure of low lying bridges is possible. The public is urged to be cautious as the inclement weather may result in fast flowing streams and deep water. The storms, which will be accompanied by lightning, hail and strong winds may pose a danger to lives, vehicles and structures," he said. 
Earlier this week, heavy rains battered parts of the province with scores being left homeless.
In New Hanover, just outside Pietermaritzburg, residents were left reeling after a tornado ripped through the area. 

Two people were killed while 18 more were injured. At least 200 homes in Mpolweni were damaged. 
Meanwhile, the Department of Education issued a statement calling for schools to send pupils, who were not writing examinations, to go home.
