TV personality and radio host Lerato Kganyago's recent tweet has twitter users all fired up. 
Kganyago came to Rachel Kolisi's defense after user started dragging her when Miss SA's Instagram video of Siya Kolisi spotting her at the Springboks homecoming following the their World Cup win went viral. 

In the video, Siya is seen making his way through the crowd and stops in his tracks to great Zozibini Tunzi.

 In various tweets aimed at Rachel, Twitter users brought up her previous social media scandals including her saying that Siya is not a type (he's a married man with four kids) and when she slammed a woman online for allegedly sliding into the Springboks Rugby captain's DMs.
They had also warned her not to check his DM's because it could be "very messy". 
Defending Rachel, Kganyago said: "A lot of Black Women being so unnecessarily mean towards Rachel Kolisi makes me cringe! Says a lot about us! Ga ke kwešiše why re le so! Gwa Swabiša!".

However, there were tweeps that disagreed with the "Project Runway" presenter's sentiments.


 




Lerato's tweet is now opening room for Black men and patriarchy princesses to tweet trash about Black women and paint Black women as these vile and jealous beings. Ukunya nje.

Its sad they are playing up her insecurities. Also just to play devils advocate Rachel should have never ever gone public with the dm's&replying to female fans as it should have been dealt in private but now people on social media will unfairly attack her cause of it.
