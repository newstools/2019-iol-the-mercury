Durban - WITH rampant crime crippling their businesses, KwaZulu-Natal business owners are taking the safety and security of their businesses and their customers into their own hands.
In an attempt to address escalating crime in the Pietermaritzburg CBD, business owners have come together to create the Community on Patrol (COP) project, which was launched last week.

COP spokesperson Essop Dawood said the project mainly comprised members of the business community.
He said crime had affected people and business in Pietermaritzburg to the extent that the CBD was “dying a slow death”. 
“COP will give the authorities a 30-day deadline to respond to the concerns of the community and to do the job they are paid to do. Failing which we will implement initiatives and structures to deal with criminals within the framework of the law,” said Dawood.

Businesses in Isipingo, south of Durban, are also struggling with crime.
A recent spate of robberies, targeting trucks delivering goods to shops in the Isipingo CBD, resulted in many suppliers opting not to deliver in the area.
Business owners held a meeting on Tuesday to come up with a plan.

Isipingo Business Forum chairperson Junaid Iqbal said the business forum members were trying to create a self-sustaining private security body which would work in partnership with the city and SAPS to fight crime.
He added that although different shops had private security guards, there was no co-ordination between those guards.
