Durban - A large group, some armed with machetes, invaded a vacant piece of land - between Newlands West and KwaDabeka - yesterday.
The group arrived in cars and taxis, and parked on Dumisani Makhaye Drive, blocking off one lane to traffic.

They said they had been told by a “committee” that they could build their shacks on the land.
Some had started clearing the bush to demarcate plots.
One of the committee members, who did not want to be named, said they would be meeting with the municipality today to discuss the use of the land, which he said fell under Ntuzuma A section.

He added that the “committee” was collecting R5 from each person who wanted to build on the land, to assist with the paperwork that was required to be presented to the municipality. However, he declined to specify what documents these were.
He added that there will be a meeting tomorrow to give feedback to the people.
Princess Nxumalo, who was at the site, said: “We heard that there are available places where we can build shacks. We had a meeting with the committee and I asked them to talk nicely with the municipality,” she said.

She added that after she spoke at the meeting, a committee member asked her to join them but she refused.
The Mercury was unable to obtain a comment from the municipality. 
Newlands West ward 37 councillor Barbara Zulu said she was not aware of the land grab.
