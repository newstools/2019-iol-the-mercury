Durban - The eThekwini Municipality has called on its residents to record their monthly electricity usage and provide it to the council.
EThekwini Municipality acting city mayor Fawzia Peer made the call after The Mercury reported on a municipal audit committee report that revealed at least 7000 electricity meters had not been read for the past year. 

The audit committee’s first-quarter report was presented to the city’s executive committee (Exco) this week. 
Peer said the 7000 meters discussed in the Exco meeting on Tuesday amounted to just 2% of the meters in the city. In addition, Peer said the city had since reduced the number of electricity meters that had not been read to 135 in the first quarter of the year. 
“It will be helpful if the community worked with the council and took their readings monthly, so as to get the most accurate and up-to-date bill,” Peer said. 

Residents can SMS their meter readings to 30909 or email customercare@elec.durban.gov.za,
When audit committee chairperson Nala Mhlongo presented the report in Exco, he said the committee recommended that city management urgently attend to the state of the electricity department and establish why thousands of meters had not been read. 
In the audit report, the Revenue Management System steering committee had not been able to provide reasons why thousands of electricity meters were not read.
