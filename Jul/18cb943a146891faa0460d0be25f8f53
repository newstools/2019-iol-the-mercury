Durban - The family of kidnapped Sandra Moonsamy has said that investigations into her whereabouts and efforts to ensure her safe return home were still under way.
The 40-year-old Durban businesswoman was accosted and bundled into a car by a gang of armed men along Stapleton Road in Pinetown in May.

Moonsamy’s parents and her two brothers run the family’s multimillion-rand truck business, Crossmoor Transport, where she worked in the finance department.
Inderan Naicker, speaking on behalf of Moonsamy’s family, said: “While every passing day makes the burden on our family due to Sandra’s absence heavier, we remain optimistic that she will be returned to us safely. 
“We are working closely with authorities to follow up on any new leads and seek out new details which could assist us in locating her.” 

He added that it was crucial to the investigation that people and the media refrained from sharing or publishing any information that was not verified, as this could hamper the ongoing investigations, essentially putting Moonsamy’s well-being at further risk. 
“We continue to marvel at the kindness and support we have received from all over the country and want to sincerely thank all those supporting us for their generosity during this difficult time.” 
Naicker said the family had requested that any information pertinent to the investigation be directed immediately to the Hawks at 0861234333.

The Hawks could not be reached for comment yesterday.
