Durban - eThekwini councillors at a full council sitting on Wednesday morning opted to give the bottled water on their tables, a miss. 
Councillors were present and accounted for at the meeting, but declined to drink the water supplied. 

Could it be due to allegations of paraffin-laced water doing the rounds at the City Hall? We don’t know. 

 


A few weeks ago, acting mayor Fawzia Peer was rushed to hospital after she drank water allegedly laced with paraffin. Peer suffered burns to her mouth, tongue and throat. 
The water bottle was taken for sample testing but results came back clear. 

Then last week, Peer’s personal assistant Hazel Moonsamy, was reportedly rushed to hospital after she too, “consumed paraffin water”. But the city quickly shut that down adding the Moonsamy had collapsed because she was sick. 
Mayoral spokesperson, Mthunzi Gumede, said had been granted sick leave.
“We would like to reassure eThekwini residents and visitors that our city provides clean and drinkable water. There seems to be certain elements who want to create and sustain a dangerous narrative regarding our water since April this year. This has been rejected several times and we will continue to reject such a narrative,” Gumede said. 

Taking to social media, DA councillor Sharmaine Sewshanker, joked about "checking if the bottled water is safe to drink".


 

Others brought their own water and juice bottles.
