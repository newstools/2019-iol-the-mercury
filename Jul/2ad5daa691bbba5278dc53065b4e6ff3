Durban - THE DA has requested a report detailing how R1.1million was spent on an event hosted by the municipality and the Department of Human Settlements and Public Works to discuss service delivery issues in uMlazi.
The DA’s Nicole Graham said the city owed its ratepayers a detailed report on how the money was spent. 

“We have a right to know how R575000 was spent on what essentially is a community meeting,” she said. Graham said they were not disputing the need for the meeting, as it was necessary to communicate with the community following myriad service delivery challenges in the area. 
The township of uMlazi has faced numerous waste removal challenges over the past few years. A number of protests emerged from the dispute. The problems prompted the council to announce that the waste removal service in uMlazi would be in-sourced.
After the DA pushed for some feedback on the community meeting, chief operations officer Musa Mbhele admitted that “less than 3000” people showed up at the meeting on June 29. Mbhele said the funds were used for buses, marquees, venue hire, security and sound.
