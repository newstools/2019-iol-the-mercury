Durban - The family of a 22-year-old Tongaat woman whose body was found in an abandoned building are battling to come to terms with her death. 

 

 The body of Komell Pillay was found on Sunday by a member of the community who alerted the police. 

 

 Police have confirmed a case of murder has been opened. 

 

 Desray Gounden said her younger sister had gone to a local nightclub on Saturday night with a friend and failed to return home. 

 

 Gounden said Pillay did not have her cellphone with her. 

 

 "While trying to (establish) her whereabouts on Sunday we received a phone call from a police officer at the Tongaat SAPS notifying us of my sister's death."

 

 Gounden said speculations that she was strangled and raped was unfounded at this time, as the post-mortem results have yet to be released.

 

 “We are still awaiting information from the police," said Gounden adding that no arrangements had been made for her sister's funeral. 

 

 Captain Nqobile Gwala said the deceased had been found half-naked in an abandoned building. 

 

 Gwala said the cause of death would be determined during the post-mortem.
