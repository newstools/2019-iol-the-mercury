DURBAN - A 45-year-old man has been convicted and sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment on charges relating to drug dealing.
Maliki Erick Ngobeni was arrested in May 2017, after Hawks officials from Richards Bay followed up on information about a car with drugs, travelling from Golela port of entry to Pongola. 

The vehicle was intercepted on the N2, near Stilo. 
The Hawks KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said officers recovered 145 bags of heroine powder, with an estimated street value of R101million. 
“Ngobeni and his two passengers were immediately placed under arrest,” Mhlongo said. 

He said investigations revealed that the drugs had come from Mozambique and were destined for Joburg. 
“It was also discovered that Ngobeni was the mastermind behind the drug trafficking. 
“His bail was successfully opposed, and he appeared in court several times before he was convicted and sentenced,” Mhlongo said.
