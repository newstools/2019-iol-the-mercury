Durban - The Public Servants Association (PSA) says it is very concerned that the sprinklers and water pumps were not functioning properly at Addington Hospital when a fire broke out on Tuesday.
The PSA’s KwaZulu-Natal manager, Claude Naiker, said it seemed that litter that had accumulated in the stairwell had caught on fire. 

“We are not sure how the fire started,” said Naiker.
He said the litter had accumulated because cleaners were unable to clear the waste on a daily basis because the lifts had not been working regularly and were continually breaking down.
“The fire took place near the paediatric unit. Babies and mothers had to be evacuated,” he said.

“Had the fire been a much bigger one, this would have caused extensive damage and also a serious risk to patients and staff,” he added. 
KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu visited the hospital on Wednesday.
She thanked the security officers and the staff for responding promptly to evacuate patients. Ncamisile Mkhize
