Durban - Several employees at the Ngqura Container Terminal have been suspended. 
Since last week, a group of workers had embarked on a go-slow, allegedly over salary disputes. 

Transnet issued a statement on Thursday explaining that the illegal industrial action has had a negative impact on port operations. 
"Workers at the Ngqura Container Terminal have been on a protracted go-slow and operations at the Durban Container Terminal have also been affected by equipment failure and a high-level absenteeism. Furthermore, decline in performance levels at the Cape Town Container Terminal has been noted. Transnet has established a daily command centre manned by national and local leadership to closely monitor performance," said Transnet spokesperson, Molatwane Likhethe. 
 He said Transnet has established a daily command centre manned by national and local leadership to monitor performance. 

Likhethe said workers have issued a list of demands which include an incentive. 
"Discussions are also being held with labour with a view to normalise port operations, while the impact on the economy has not been quantified yet," he said.
