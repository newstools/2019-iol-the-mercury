Durban - Pam Golding intern estate agent Basil Underhill and his two co-accused have arrived at the Durban High Court ahead of their sentencing for the brutal murder of former KZN principal Gona Pillay. 
 Pillay was strangled to death in her Silverglen home in September 2017 while her husband Loga helplessly looked on. 

 The couple had enlisted the services of Basil to sell their 7-bedroom home. 
 They had planned to downsize and move into a seaside apartment in Amanzimtoti. 
 On Tuesday Braveman Underhill and Fredboy Msomi were also  convicted of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances.

Msomi was convicted of theft.
