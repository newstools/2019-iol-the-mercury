Durban - The Pinetown woman charged with the kidnapping and murder of a 10-year-old girl has opted to remain behind bars.
Zandile Nsele, who appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court yesterday, chose not to apply for bail.

Siphumelele Mzimba disappeared nearly four weeks ago in Nazareth, near Pinetown. Mzimba’s decomposed body was found buried near Nsele’s home last Thursday.
Mzimba was reported missing after she went to a hairdresser near her home but never reached her destination on June 13. Later that day, her parents received a message demanding a ransom of R20000.
A few days after the ransom demand, Nsele was arrested in connection with Mzimba’s disappearance.

The court heard that a charge of murder would be added to the kidnapping and extortion charges she was already facing. The State alleged in court that the 39-year-old Nsele strangled the young girl with a cable. 
KZN MEC for Social Development Nonhlanhla Khoza said that Nsele had been arrested in Johannesburg, which showed that she could be a flight risk if granted bail. The case was remanded to August 20.
