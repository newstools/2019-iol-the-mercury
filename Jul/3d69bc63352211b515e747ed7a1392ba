Durban - THE ward councillor in Silverglen, Chatsworth, has urged the police to increase their visibility in the area after a 59-year-old man was killed and his brother, 56, was injured in a home invasion yesterday.
It is alleged that suspects entered the premises, assaulted one brother and fatally stabbed the other. 

The spokesperson for Amawele Emergency Services, Sivan Subramodey, said the victim was pronounced dead at the scene.
“The man who was stabbed in the head was treated and taken to the family doctor,” said Subramodey. 
It is alleged the suspects entered the home through a lounge window, which they forced open, and stole a flat-screen TV.

Ward councillor, Tony Govender, described the incident as “very tragic”. 
“I live one road away from the home where the incident happened,” said Govender. 
He added that he had arrived at the scene three minutes after the incident. 

“The family and the whole community are very traumatised and shocked,” he said.
Govender said he was worried about the dramatic increase in crime in Sliverglen.
“The police must help us by increasing police visibility in the area. We hope that they will arrest the culprits soon.”

When The Mercury visited the family yesterday, they refused to speak, saying they were still mourning the loss of their loved one.
