Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu has called for an urgent probe into the death of a patient at RK Khan, who reportedly had maggots coming out of his mouth.
Sadek Ebrahim, 52, died on Wednesday after being admitted to the hospital on June 19. 

A video emerged this week showing maggots moving around in the visibly unwell man's month.
Ebrahim’s son found the maggots in his father's mouth after noticing that his upper lip was badly swollen. 
Simelane-Zulu said the department was shocked by Ebrahim’s condition in the video.

“We don't understand how things could have got to this level," said Simelane-Zulu.
The Mercury's sister newspaper, Post, reported that the man had died of natural causes.
Simelane-Zulu called on the department's health staff to take their jobs seriously. 

“While we understand that they are under pressure, once a patient is with you, as a doctor or nurse, you need to make a thorough assessment,” she said.
The IFP's KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson on health, Ncamisile Nkwanyana, said drastic action was needed to address the incident.
“The South African health-care system continues to let our people down. Although people have free public health care, the competence, attitude of staff and quality of treatment is disastrous, and leaves a lot to be desired,” said Nkwanyana.
