Durban - AS from this month, some Durban taxpayers will have access to tax services in their local communities without needing to travel to SA Revenue Service (Sars) offices.
eThekwini Municipality has signed an agreement in terms of which Sars will be able to use municipal Sizakala Service Centres to offer some tax services to residents, especially for those living far from tax offices.

Tax registrations, the completion and submission of tax returns, submission of Paye reconciliations and EasyFile assistance, statements of accounts, general enquiries, and changes to registered particulars are the services that will be offered. 
The decision was first announced by eThekwini’s Committee on Human Resources, and the services are expected to be available as soon as next Monday. 
Councillor Barbara Fortein said the partnership was a true reflection of the government’s commitment to service delivery.

Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said Sars would assign its Mobile Tax Unit with trained staff at Sizakala Centres and render tax-related services.
“The partnership with Sars will afford the eThekwini Municipality the opportunity to provide the community access to tax-related services closer to where they are living.
“The Sizakala Customer Service Unit will provide facilities for Sars to operate and conduct awareness programmes.” 

The services will be available from July8 at MegaCity Sizakala Centre - uMlazi, Mnini Thusong Centre - Umnini/Mgababa. On the fourth Monday of the month, they will be available at Mpumalanga Sizakala Centres - Mpumalanga Township/Hammarsdale and Verulam Sizakala Centre - Verulam.
