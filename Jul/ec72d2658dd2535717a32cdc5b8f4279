DURBAN - The city has paid R200000 towards a civic funeral for former municipal councillor Colin Gaillard.
Gaillard, who died last week, had served on a number of committees including the city’s executive committee. He was buried yesterday.

In a report brought to the executive committee yesterday, Gaillard was described as a man who exercised a strong oversight role to ensure speedy and effective service delivery. In line with the provision of the Civic Funeral Policy, the report was brought to council to approve the funding. 
It was not clear yesterday whether the funds had already been paid to Gaillard’s family.
Although the DA supported the recommendation to give Gaillard a civic funeral, the party said it could not support the cost. 

The DA’s Nicole Graham said although Gaillard was a “very respectable councillor”, the council could not cough up R200 000 every time a councillor died, “especially for people who fought all their lives for financial discipline”.
However, ANC councillors Barbara Fortein and Sipho Kaunda said the cost of funerals was high. 
“We have to respect the councillor’s passing, do you realise how expensive funerals are?” Fortein asked.

The committee approved the report and it was promised that the governance and human resources portfolio committee would provide a breakdown of costs by the end of next month.
