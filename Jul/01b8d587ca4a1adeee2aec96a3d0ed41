DURBAN - Two former Mnambithi Further Education and Training (FET) College officials have been sentenced to three years imprisonment on 12 counts of tender fraud committed at the college.
KwaZulu-Natal Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said Mphilisi Claude Mkhize and Tholakele Gracia Nzimande were sentenced at the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court.

He said in April 2013, the Mnambithi FET College appointed a forensic company to investigate irregularities in the procurement of goods and services by the college. 
“This was after allegations of corruption were levelled against the convicted pair, a procurement officer and a lecturer respectively at the same college. Investigations revealed that in 2011, the pair conspired and manipulated the tender processes of the college, a tender for the supply and removal of waste containers at the campus was unduly awarded to Mkhize despite the fact that no services were rendered, the college suffered losses of up to R273756 as a result of wasteful and fruitless expenditure,” Mhlongo said. 
He said a case of fraud was reported at Ladysmith SAPS and the case docket was allocated to the Hawks’ members from the Pietermaritzburg Serious Commercial Crime unit for further investigation. 

Mkhize and Nzimande were arrested in May 2015 and were sentenced last week.
