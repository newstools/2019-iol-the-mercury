Johannesburg - Condolences have started to pour in after a former soccer player was shot dead on Monday night.
 Marc Batchelor, who famously donned the Number 25 jersey for both Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, was gunned down in his BMW in Olivedale, Randburg.  

 Former Orlando Pirates striker Lennox Bacela was one of the most prominent figures to take to Twitter to send the condolences to Batchelor’s family. 
 Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed his identity and said no arrests had been made after he was ambushed on his driveway. 
 “Police are investigating a murder case after a former soccer player, Marc Batchelor was attacked by two men driving a motorbike in Olivedale outside his house. 

 “He was shot several times and died inside his vehicle. The suspects then drove away without taking anything,” said Dlamini. 
 Police said the motive for the attack was unknown at this stage. 
 Pictures from the crime scene showed Batchelor's car had been sprayed with several bullets.
