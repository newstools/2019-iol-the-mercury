Durban - TRANSNET has suspended several employees at its Ngqura Container Terminal in Port Elizabeth.
This comes after employees embarked on a go-slow over alleged bonus disputes. 

Yesterday, Transnet spokesperson Molatwane Likhethe confirmed that the illegal industrial strike action had a negative impact on port operations. 
This also led to berthing issues at the Durban harbour. 
Likhethe said the go-slow was having a negative impact on all customers serviced by the port, particularly the citrus and automotive customers.

“Workers at the Ngqura Container Terminal have been on a protracted go-slow and operations at the Durban Container Terminal have also been affected by equipment failure and high-level absenteeism. Furthermore, a decline in performance levels at the Cape Town Container Terminal has been noted,” he said. 
He said a daily command centre had been set up and was being manned by national and local leadership to closely monitor performance.
Durban Harbour Carriers Association chairperson Sue Moodley said the go-slow had a major impact on both the country’s import and export markets.

“This is a huge dent on our already suffering economy. Such a situation will not give importers or exporters any confidence should this situation remain unresolved. So, yes, there is a huge negative economic impact,” she said. 
Peter Besnard, chief executive of the South African Association of Ship Operators and Agents, said: “At this point in time, the go-slow is impacting heavily on shipping and our already fragile economy.”
