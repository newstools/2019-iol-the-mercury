Durban - A fire swept through an informal settlement on Johanna Road in Kenville this morning leaving the community without homes according to Blue Security.
 Andreas Mathios, Blue Security spokesperson said it was unclear how the fire was started.

 He said upon arrival the security officers assisted the fire department with evacuation procedures.

 “A makeshift creche was set up to coordinate a central meeting point for a number of toddlers as young as four-years-old to be kept out of harm's way,” said Mathios.

 Mathios said the makeshift creche allowed firefighters easier access to fight the fire.
 “The men from the community were spurred into action and they helped firefighters contain some of the swirling flames on one of the flanks,” he added.
 He said the community rallied to save their belongings as the raging fire tore through the homes.

Alpha Alarms who were also on the scene this morning said it is unknown if there were any fatalities.
