Durban - PATIENTS living in Zululand and areas in northern KwaZulu-Natal needing specialised catheterisation and cardiac treatment will no longer have to travel several hundred kilometres for treatment.
The Melomed Richards Bay Hospital recently opened its catheterisation laboratory (cath lab) and heart centre. 

This is the first centre of its kind and will bring life-saving services closer to people living in the communities. 
The centre also has a cardiac theatre and ICU. 
With a limited amount of time (known as the “Golden Hour”) to perform an intervention once a person suffers a heart attack or stroke, the hospital said it had made the distance to the closest cardiac cath lab shorter and safer. 

This would also save time and money for family and friends who no longer have to travel to Durban.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, accounting for more than 17.3 -million deaths per year, according to the American Heart Association’s Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2016 update.
The hospital said the cath lab boasts the latest technology and a multimillion-rand catheterisation machine that allows doctors to perform complicated medical and surgical procedures.
