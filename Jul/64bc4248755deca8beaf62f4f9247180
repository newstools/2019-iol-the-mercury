Durban - The abandoned building where a 23-year-old Tongaat girl was found murdered has been demolished. 

 

 A community activist said the building had been demolished on Tuesday; 
 a day before murder accused Siphiwe Fiso Mthembu made his fourth appearance in the Verulam Magistrate's Court charged for the murder of Komell Pillay. 

 

 Pillay's half naked body was found in the abandoned building on July 7. Mthembu was arrested a few days later and remains in police custody. 

 

 He made a brief appearance in court on Wednesday and the matter had to be postponed as they were unable to secure Mthembu's residential address for purposes of bail. 

 

 State prosecutor, Winnie Mlangeni expressed her dissatisfaction with the delay and requested that a final date be set.
