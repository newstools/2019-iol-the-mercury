Durban - Police have arrested two people in connection with the murder of two security guards, who were beaten to death at Ukusa Secondary School in Hammarsdale earlier this month.
Police confirmed that the Mpumalanga police, Inanda Task Team and Magma Security arrested the men yesterday in Amaoti, near Inanda.

The brutal attack on guards at the Hammarsdale school left the community reeling.
A third guard who was assaulted was left critically injured.
It is believed the suspects were after the schoolâ€™s computer equipment.

The attackers allegedly wanted the guards to open the strong room, and when they refused to do so, they were dragged into a classroom where they were severely assaulted.
The dead guards were Mncedisi Ntuli, 29, who had just been employed at the school, and his colleague, Thandazani Majola, 46, who had been at the school for three years.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the two suspects, aged 23 and 28, would appear in court soon.
