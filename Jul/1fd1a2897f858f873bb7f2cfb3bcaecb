 Police spokesman, Jay Naicker in a message on a SAPS and journalist WhatsApp group said: "Colleagues, please wear your media cards around your necks so that police officer cannot claim that they did not know that you are journalists".
 Erasmus said the situation was tense.
Mavuso had not been released by police at the time of publication.

Durban Metro Police spokesperson Glen Ndlovu said he was sad to hear a journalist was arrested and it could be a result of a misunderstanding at the scene.
