Durban - A 13-year-old girl was rushed to hospital with severe injuries after being attacked by a pit bull while walking along Dr.R.D.Naidu Drive in Durban on Monday. 
 

 Garrith Jamieson, a spokesperson for Rescue Care paramedics, said the girl was walking on the pavement along D.R. Naidu Drive when she was attacked by two pitbulls near the intersection with Crocus Road in Asherville. 

 
 
  "She 
  sustained serious injuries and needed advanced life support to stabilise her. She was bitten on the head,face and arms. Paramedics transported her to hospital. 
  One of the dogs was killed by an unknown person while the other is still at large,"Jamieson said. 
 
 
  
   
  
  
   At the time of reporting the owner of the dog could not be traced. 
  
  
   
  
  
   However a bystander said that a group of people arrived at the scene and were more concerned with what happened to the dog than the child. 
  
  
   
  
  
   The group got into a heated argument with police at the scene. 
  
  
   
  
  
   It is believed a police officer patrolling the area shot one of the dogs dead. 
  
  
    
  
  
   Sydenham Police are on the scene. 
  
  
   
  
  
   Jamieson said the family of the girl was still being contacted to inform them of the situation.
