Durban - Violent protests that erupted on Wednesday at the University of KwaZulu-Natal had fizzled out by midday yesterday after aggrieved students were dispersed by police and campus security.
As many as 100 students protested at the UKZN Westville campus yesterday morning. They burnt debris and broke bottles along the road leading to the university. 

It was believed the protests erupted after the exclusion of some students from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). 
UKZN student representative council (SRC) president Sanele Hlongwa said that the grievances were isolated to Westville campus, as it also involved the poor state of student residences on the campus and registration for the second semester.
“For the first time, registration was only opened for two weeks at the campus. Some students felt this was not enough time for them to get their things in order,” he said. 

UKZN did not respond to a request for comment yesterday. However, The Mercury’s sister newspaper Post reported that the university management would engage student leadership to resolve their concerns and issues raised. “We are committed to restoring peace and stability on campus, and ensuring that teaching and learning takes place as scheduled,” said Ashton Bodrick, executive director of corporate relations.
Hlongwa said they hoped to meet with university management today to start discussions around the issues raised by the students.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Public Order Police would remain at the university to monitor the situation.
