Durban - KwaZulu-Natal theatre couple, Aaron McIlroy and Lisa Bobbert McIlroy, are putting the pieces of their lives back together after their home was razed in a fire at the weekend. The couple were away at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown at the time. 
Taking to social media, friends of the couple have come together to collect clothing and bedding for them. 

McIlroy said they were overwhelmed by the love and support shown by people. 
They arrived in Durban earlier on Monday to assess the damage. 
The couple's daughter, her friend and a family friend were in the house but escaped unharmed. 

“Please forgive us if we have not responded to all the messages individually as we have literally not had the time.The fact that no one was hurt in the fire is the real blessing. We are so thankful for your prayers at this time please continue to hold us up in your prayers and thoughts at this very stressful time as we start rebuilding our home. Thank you all so much,” McIlroy said on Facebook. 

 
 
  A printed prayer was one of the few items that was found, untouched, in the fire.
 


Family friend, Sonia Corris, said they have been praying for the couple.
