Durban - THE Mpofana (Mooi River) Municipality is in serious danger of having its electricity switched off by Eskom as early as today.
Eskom spokesperson Joyce Zingoni said no agreement had been reached between Eskom and the municipality.

She directed further communication on the matter to the municipality.
The municipality owes Eskom an estimated R120 million and has dishonoured several agreements to make payments. 
Eskom recently published a notice of intent to “interrupt” electricity supply to Mpofana daily, beginning today from 6am. 

The negotiations between the state- owned enterprise and the municipality over the electricity bill started about a month ago. 
Several municipalities in the province have experienced difficulties in making payments to Eskom. 
MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka said they had been in negotiations with Eskom at the weekend to try to stop the scheduled power cuts.

Cogta said there had been intense discussions on how to prevent power cuts in Mpofana Municipality. 
It said while there appeared to be no immediate solution, both parties were optimistic that a breakthrough might still be found. Attempts to get comment from the municipality were unsuccessful.
