Durban - 
 CCTV footage allegedly linking Colin Pillay to the brutal murders of a Phoenix mother and her two daughters are expected to be shown in Durban High Court today. 

 

 Jane Govindasamy, 45, a receptionist, her daughters Denisha, 22, unemployed and Nikita, 16, Grade 11 pupil were found murdered in their Longcroft, Phoenix home in September 2018. 

 

 Their bodies were found by their father Sagren Govindsamy. Govindsamy is demanding justice after his entire family was wiped out. 

 

 
  Pillay,46, a tow truck driver, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder and theft at the start of his trial on Monday. 
 

 

 At the start of day two of the murder trial, Warrant Officer Rajen Saunders testified about what he saw on CCTV footage obtained from a boutique in Longcroft which clearly shows Pillay wiping and 
 discarding a silver object on the roadside.

 

 The boutique is 100 metres away from the victim's home. 

 

 "I noticed him remove a object from himself and throw it across the road. The object looked silver which could possibly be a knife."

 

 The court heard that Saunders left the boutique and walked 10 meters to the spot where the object was discarded where h
 e found a knife with a black handle. 

 

 Saunders told the court that he cordoned off the area and called in the forensics department. 

 

 * This CCTV footage is expected to be shown in court.
