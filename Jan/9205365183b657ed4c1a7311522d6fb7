Durban - Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Zweli Mkhize, came under fire after he shared photographs of himself exiting a hut during a visit to Ward 5 in Georgedale near Hammarsdale earlier today. 
Mkhize's visit to the area formed part of ongoing celebrations marking the African National Congress's 107th anniversary. 

Mkhize shared the photographs on his Twitter shortly after, adding that the elderly woman lived alone in the house.

And even when the MEC tweeted that a sponsor had come forward to build a decent home for the gogo, still, Twitter was not impressed.

Since elections are on the way, you will go all the way out to find houses like that and play hero card. But thank you for nameless” sponsor”.
