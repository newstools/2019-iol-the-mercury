DURBAN - Zimbabweans living in KwaZulu-Natal described the situation in their home country as “very worrying”, adding that the ruling Zanu-PF is resorting to its old tactics.
Albert Hororo said the situation is disturbing, to say the least. 

“This did not come as a surprise as I was expecting it. 
Hororo said the army was instrumental in keeping former president Robert Mugabe in power and was now doing the same for President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
His countryman Kudzai Taruona, who was in Zimbabwe over the festive season, said people were yearning for the return of the Mugabe era. 

“All you hear is that Mugabe was better than Emmerson Mnangagwa. He is a huge disappointment. People expected a lot better from him..”
Taruona said the situation was quickly approaching a tipping point, with the economic situation deteriorating fast. 
“People have been severely impoverished and hunger stokes the nation. Prices are skyrocketing, yet people have no money. 

“They expected the new president - who has been parroting the ‘Zimbabwe is open for business’ mantra - to improve their lives, but he has shown no mercy on them,” he said.
Makusha Hupenyu decried the country’s monetary policy, describing it as “confusing and escalating the crisis”.
“The fuel increase and increases in the prices of basic commodities have worsened the situation. It is just chaotic. 

“I believe the people are justified in their reaction as this is the only way to express how they feel..”
