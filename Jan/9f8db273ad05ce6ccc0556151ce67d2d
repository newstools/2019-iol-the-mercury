DURBAN - A broken femur is not stopping water activist Mina Guli from promoting her #RunningDry campaign to raise awareness about the global water crisis.
Guli has appealed to the world to come together on Sunday, January 27, to run 100 marathons in one day.

“I will honestly be forever grateful to every single person, young or old, walker or runner, for taking time out to help raise awareness for the global water crisis that we are facing.
“I have always said that I want to make saving water so famous that it’s no longer the right thing to do, but the only thing to do. That dream is now becoming a reality,” Guli said.
Earlier this month, Guli had halted her challenge to run 100 marathons around the world in 100 days after doctors discovered a stress fracture to her right femur. Guli had continued the campaign, walking a further three marathons in South Africa to complete marathon #62. However, the injury only worsened.

On Sunday, the #RunningDry community will attempt 100 marathons in one day, worldwide, for one reason: water.
Guli said that to take part, supporters would simply run or walk a marathon, or part of a marathon, and log their distance on social media with the hashtag #RunningDry.
Supporters are encouraged to share water facts, available on Guli’s website, and invite their friends to join.

“There’s an African proverb that says: ‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.’ Well, I’ve gone about as far as I can alone. The next 25 days of #RunningDry are all about collective action,” Guli said.
