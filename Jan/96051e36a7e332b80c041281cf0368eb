DURBAN - Avid South African rower John Dempster will compete in one of the hardest ocean rowing races in the world to highlight the plight of mental health issues and teen suicide.
Dempster will row solo in the Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge in December, over a distance of 4800km, in the hope of breaking the stigma attached to people who have suffered from mental health issues.

He also aims to speak out about the mental health struggles he has faced over the past three years, while hoping to inspire other South Africans to seek help for their own mental health issues.
“The Watering the Mind Campaign is a chance for me to be open with others about my struggles. By rowing across the Atlantic I hope to show others that struggling with your mental health does not mean you’re a weak person and that great things can still be achieved,” Dempster said.
He said that over the years, his life seemed to repeat the same cycle of depression and anxiety.

Dempster has partnered with Sadag and their “Suicide Shouldn’t Be a Secret” programme, which aims to lower teenage suicide rates by interacting with rural high school pupils.
Of Dempster’s campaign, Sadag board chairperson and psychiatrist Dr Frans Korb said: “Your support and unbelievable contribution towards those in dire need of mental health care is remarkable. You are truly an inspiration to all.”
The race begins in December, with up to 30 teams participating from across the globe. They will gather in the Canary Islands village of San Sebastian, in La Gomera, before the event.
