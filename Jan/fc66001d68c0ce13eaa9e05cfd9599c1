Durban - A month after Durban North teenager Kiara Mun-Gavin sustained extensive brain damage in an accident in Durban, she is finally going home. 
 

 On Friday morning her mother Jaci sent a broadcast message on Whatsapp informing family and friends of the good news. 
 
  
 
 
  "And a truly good morning it is. Kiara has been given the all clear to come home for a few days to be with her family before going back in for her cranioplasty. 
 
 
  
   
  
  
   "We celebrate this moment. First, because we didn’t know if we’d get it a few weeks ago, and second, because we don’t know what lies ahead. But today, we have Kiara walking through the hospital doors to be with us. 
   Thank you Jesus
    for today." 
  
  
   
  
  
   Kiara and Jaci had been on their way to the Anthem Church in Mackeurtan Avenue when they were involved in an accident with a delivery motorbike on December 24. 
  
 

 

 Shortly after doctors operated on Kiara they had to remove a large part of her skull because of the swelling in her brain. 

 

 The skull was placed in her abdomen for preservation.
