Durban - Metro Police officers gathered at the site where one of their colleagues was killed, to pay homage to a man who had spent much of his life dedicated to fighting crime and keeping his community safe. 
 

 On Monday morning, officers stood in a circle and prayed near the Galleria shopping centre, south of Durban, where the incident took place.

 

 Inspector Johan Deysel was killed on Friday night after a taxi driver failed to stop at a roadblock.  In a video that has since surfaced and gone viral on social media, Deysel is seen flashing his torch to get the driver to stop at the side of the road. 

 

 The taxi is seen approaching Deysel at considerable speed and fails to stop. Deysel tries to get out of the taxi's way and his hit. 

 

 The taxi driver has been arrested and charged with culpable homicide. He is due to appear in the Amanzimtoti Magistrate's Court on Monday.  

 

 Deysel has been described as a straightforward, no-nonsense kind of officer. He would have celebrated his 60th birthday next month.
