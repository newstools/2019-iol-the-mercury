DURBAN - The two Tongaat Home Affairs officials who were recorded using cellphones while on duty have received written warnings after it emerged that they used the devices during a power failure.
The video of the two officials went viral on social media last week amid complaints from the public about service at the branch.

David Hlabane, the provincial Home Affairs spokesperson, said the department has completed its investigation involving the officials.
He said the video created an impression that they were on their cellphones instead of attending to people waiting to be served.
“During the investigation it was established that the office experienced a power failure on the day leading to a break in service that lasted for approximately 20 minutes,” he said.

Hlabane said officials resumed work and served clients as soon as the system was restored. “The break in service was announced to clients,” he said.
Hlabane said there were compelling reasons for the officials to use their cellphones during the service break, but they should have excused themselves to attend to personal matters at the back office.

According to him, the officials were working overtime on the day the video was shot and they used the break to deal with emergencies.
He said written warnings were believed to be a sufficient sanction for both officials as they had no pending misconduct cases against them and had a good work record.

“The officials acknowledged their mistake and voluntarily apologised for the misjudgment,” he said.
Acting Director-General Thulani Mavuso said, on the basis of the findings, a second chance was justifiable. “It would encourage our officials to always exercise good judgement and adhere to departmental policies,” he said.
Mavuso said Home Affairs provincial manager Cyril Mncwabe would continue to ensure officials adhered to the cellphone use policy while at work.
