Durban - The Fresha Festival of free fun family al-fresco theatre will be staged for the third time on Durban’s North Beach later this month. 
The Fresha team has selected a programme of vibrant, engaging works that are non-verbal and last just 15-20 minutes. All the shows are in the daylight, in the open-air and free to all.  The format of the day for Saturday and Sunday is similar with shows which are accessible to people of all ages, family-friendly and from all walks of life. Festival Director Emma Durden considered: “What could be more quintessntially Durban than a summer festival of free family theatre?

The festival will start on January 18 from 5pm and continue through the weekend. 
The Fresha Festival is directed by Emma Durden, supported by Roel Twijnstra and is presented by Twist Theatre Development Projects which focuses on the development of community theatre groups in KwaZulu-Natal, and on creating sustainable relationships and networks for theatre development, both locally and abroad. Twist is funded by The National Lotteries Commission and the Embassy of the Kingdom of The Netherlands. Additional funding for Fresha has also been graciously provided by eThekwini Municipality the Department of Arts and Culture, KZN and the KZN Performing Arts Trust.
