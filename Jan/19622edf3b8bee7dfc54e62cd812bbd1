Durban - In the days leading up to New Year's Day, various animal-care groups and centres pleaded with residents to refrain from setting off big bangs, however in the days since January 1 there have been numerous complaints of animals going missing or suffering heart attacks as a result of the letting off of loud fireworks. 
Social media was flooded with complaints from residents complaining about having to put up with loud bangs for hours on end. 

The Phoenix Animal Care & Treatment (PACT) Facebook page also posted photographs of animals found in different parts of Durban that had run away from the loud bangs.
That Bunny Farm, which is based in Inchanga, reported that one of their bunnies had suffered a stroke. 
In a post on their Facebook page, That Bunny Farm said, "The noise from the fireworks were absolutely horrendous. We have never had a problem before. (We) rushed out to calm our rabbits and although I was outside with our buns, one of our gorgeous New Zealand Blacks had a stroke. I managed to resuscitate her but she eventually passed away in my arms."

Management at the farm have expressed their anger, adding that this was the first time in five years that they had gone into creating this colour variation of the New Zealand bunny. 
"She was pre-selected for this year's Royal Show," the farm's management said. 
 

The SPCA Lower South KZN - Dogs for Adoption also posted about a young bull terrier cross having suffered a heart attack on New Year's Day.  Sally, the dog, had been adopted from the SPCA after months of waiting for a forever home. 
 
 The Kloof & Highway SPCA said The loud bangs which very often accompany fireworks cause animals great distress, fear and suffering as their hearing is far more acute than ours. Some animals cause injury to themselves by jumping through glass windows, over spiked fences or by running into traffic as examples.
