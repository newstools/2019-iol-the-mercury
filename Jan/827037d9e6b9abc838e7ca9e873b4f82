Durban - The festive season was marred by a spate of drownings and fatal road crashes across the province.
At least 10 people drowned, while more than 160 were killed on KZN roads. 

On New Year’s Day, an off-duty policeman drowned at a beach on the South Coast. 
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Port Shepstone Search and Rescue officials, tower 13 lifeguards and Medevac officials were called out to the beach, following reports of a drowning in progress. 
“The body of a 40-year-old off-duty police officer, based in Boksburg, was pulled from the water. It is believed that he got caught in a rip current and was not breathing. Despite CPR efforts, the man died at the scene. An inquest docket has been opened,” Mbhele said. 

Later the same day, a 29-year-old man drowned at a Tongaat community pool. 
He had been swimming with sa norkel at the time and when his family saw him floating in the water, they assumed he was breathing through the snorkel. 
After noticing that their relative was still in the same position a few minutes later, the family notified the lifeguard on duty. The man was declared dead at the scene. 

Police also said the search for a 9-year-old, who went missing while swimming at Durban’s North Beach on New Year’s Day, was still under way. 
Meanwhile, the Road Traffic Management Corporation has said that by mid December, the number of fatalities on KZN roads stood at 160. 
Spokesperson Simon Zwane said the final figures across the country would be released once schools opened.
