DURBAN - ANC KZN deputy chairperson Mike Mabuyakhulu and his eight co-accused will have to provide reasons next month why a restraint order granted against their assets, including six properties and 17 vehicles, should not be made final.
The assets were placed under restraint during several raids carried out yesterday by the Asset and Forfeiture Unit (AFU) against nine people and seven entities implicated in the North Sea Jazz corruption scandal.

The criminal charges relate to R28million which the KZN government paid out in around 2012 for the North Sea Jazz Festival which never took place.
Mabuyakhulu, who was the MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs at the time, is facing charges of corruption and money laundering in connection with the case.
The other accused face similar charges, including fraud.

The assets, placed under restraint in terms of an interim order granted in the Durban High Court last December, are now in the care of curator bonis Prudence Duma.
The other accused affected by the restraint order are businessman Mabheleni Ntuli, Desmond Golding and Ceaser Walter Mkhize, Zandile Mbongwe, Nothando Zungu, Nonhlanhla Ninela, Mzwandile Ninela, Ntokozo Ndlovu .
AFU and Hawks members swooped on the properties just after 5am.

Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said: “Our officials, accompanied by the AFU, sheriff and curators, served the interim restrain court orders to 16 respondents who were charged for fraud, corruption and money laundering.”
Mhlongo stressed that the criminal case had not been finalised as yet. “As a result, the assets of the respondents are not yet forfeited to the state. Furthermore, this process does not mean that the respondents are guilty,” he said.
Reacting to news of the raids, KZN ANC spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said the party supported the rule of law and hoped Mabuyakhulu would be given space to deal with the matter. Both the DA and IFP welcomed the raids.
