Durban - Protest action has again flared up in Mary Thiphe Road in Cato Crest on Tuesday afternoon. 
 

 Just after 1pm, groups of people began rolling boulders and tree trunks into the road. These items were then set alight. It is alleged that water meters and electricity boxes belonging to residents living along the road, were also destroyed. 

 

 
  
 
 

 Last week, Metro Police rushed to disperse a crowd that gathered to protest on the road. 

 

 It is believed that the latest wave of protests stems from the recent demolition of informal structures erected in the bushes nearby. Last week, on two occasions, members of the city's Land Invasion Unit moved into the area where they broke down structures. 

 

 The area has been plagued by land grabs which have often ended in violent protests. 

 

 Last month, a resident was physically attacked during a protest. Others have complained that their windows have been broken during protests.
