DURBAN - Tshwane executive mayor Solly Msimanga has questioned the circumstances surrounding the deaths of three people during the Mountain View Train Station crash in Pretoria last week.
“There are so many questions. We will try to find answers. This is a very sad moment. There is very little we can do,” said Msimanga.

He visited the families to convey his condolences yesterday.
Dick, 38, and Sarah Sekoma, 39, who leave behind six children, and Samuel Baloyi, 61, died in the crash.
The Sekomas had been taking their eldest daughter, Boitumelo, to register at Tshwane University of Technology. She suffered injuries.

A joint memorial service was held at the Forward in Faith Church in Soshanguve yesterday.
Family representative Tsakane Nkumane described the Sekomas as a loving and supportive couple.
“They were the epitome of what and how love should be. They also loved people and that was evident in the big family they had,” she said.

Neighbour and friend Sophy Malepeng described Baloyi as a funny and care-free man.
Last week, the Rail Safety Regulator released a damning preliminary report on the crash which found that a communication breakdown and the use of manual signalling had led to the crash.
