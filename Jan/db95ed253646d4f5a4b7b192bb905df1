DURBAN - The Mun-Gavin family is making plans to take their 13-year-old daughter home barely a month after she was in a coma after a car crash in Durban North on Christmas Eve.
Kiara Mun-Gavin and her mother, Jaci, were driving up Mackeurtan Avenue when a motorbike crashed into their car. Kiara was critically injured.

Her ordeal captured the hearts of the community, with hundreds of people taking to social media to pledge their support to the Mun-Gavin family.
In a post on his Facebook page, Kiara’s father, Richard Mun-Gavin, said they felt like they had a “spring” in their step.
“For the first time we have a line of sight. We have lived day-to-day until now but this gives us a plan.

“It feels like we have been given a spring in our step,” he said.
He said they had been given the go-ahead from Kiara’s neurosurgeon.
Mun-Gavin said the doctor thought the aspiring ballet dancer was ready to go home or to go to a specialised rehabilitation facility, should the family choose that option.

“Yes, she still does not have a side of her skull in place.
“Yes, she still has to have another significant surgery. Yes, she still needs therapy.
“But come on, she is going to walk out of the hospital in a few days.

“That is far more than we expected,” he said.
Mun-Gavin thanked the community for its ongoing support and prayers.
