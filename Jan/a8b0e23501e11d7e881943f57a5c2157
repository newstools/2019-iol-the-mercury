Durban - Devotees gathered at temples around the country to carry Kavady as they celebrate a Hindu festival of Thai Poosam on Monday. 
Thai Poosam Kavady is a South Indian festival celebrated all around the world over a period of 10 days in devotion to Lord Muruga. 

A Kavady is a pole with loads on either ends, this symbolizes the burdens one carries, seeking his help and guidance.  Thai Poosam Kavady is a Tamil religious festival dedicated to Tamil god Lord Murugan that is celebrated by Tamil people in South Africa.
Thai Poosam falls every year on the full moon day in the Tamil month "Thai" (January/February).

The festival occurs in the month of Thai (the 10th month on the Tamil calendar) and on the day when the full moon passes through the star "Pusam".

This event is called "Thai Poosam". This festival is one of the biggest festivals on the South Indian calendar in South Africa.
At the Himalaya Sports Grounds in Merebank, devotees carried their Kavady's on the streets to a local temple.
