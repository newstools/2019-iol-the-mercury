Durban - Four people died on Tuesday during a severe storm, when the vehicle they were travelling in was swept into the Nadi river at Greytown.
Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said two males and two females were recovered from the Ford Ranger in Ward 12 of Umvoti local municipality.

“Some appear to be teachers from Bizimali High School at Nkandla and one of the deceased is about 7 years old,” he said. 
The authorities were in the process of locating the families of the deceased for the bodies to be identified. Mabaso explained that both provincial and local teams have been dispatched to the area.
He said in Hlobane, Vryheid, gale-force winds and storms caused damage to homes and infrastructure. Other incidents were reported at Nottingham Road and Mooi River where a hailstorm left several houses damaged. Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube conveyed her condolences to the bereaved families.

“Our condolences go to the families of the victims of this tragedy. It is devastating to witness such carnage at the beginning of a new year,” said Nomusa Dube-Ncube. 
Weather forecaster William Msimanga said a severe storm alert was issued by the South African Weather Service on Monday for the western and central interior of KwaZulu-Natal ahead of the severe storms on Tuesday. 
“On Tuesday afternoon, the thunderstorms started developing over the central interior of KZN and some of those storms became severe,” said Msimanga. 

“Isolated afternoon thunderstorms will dominate KZN for the remainder of the week and the weekend,” he said.
