DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal recorded the highest number of road deaths in the country during the festive season. This is according to statistics released yesterday by Transport Minister Dr Blade Nzimande.
KZN recorded 267 crashes with 328 fatalities. It was followed by the Eastern Cape with 238 fatalities, Gauteng with 219, Limpopo with 178 and Mpumalanga with 162. The Free State recorded 159 fatalities, while Western Cape had 149, North West had 125 and Northern Cape recorded 54.

The preliminary report covers all accidents between December 1 and January 8.
Nationally, Nzimande said there were 1286 crashes and 1612 fatalities.
Commenting on the statistics, KZN Transport MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda, said while the province recorded a slight decrease in the number of crashes compared to 2017’s figure of 279, the department remains concerned about the increase in the number of fatalities.

However, he added that despite this increase in road fatalities, KZN did not feature among the provinces that recorded the highest percentage increase. “This could be attributed to the effort we made after the release of the mid-point festive season statistics,” he said.
Kaunda said the department would redouble its efforts to ensure that the proposed interventions to curb road deaths - including the implementation of the AARTO (Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences) Act and demerit point system - was carried out. He added that driver behaviour needed to be addressed as most crashes were the result of human error.
Nzimande said the factors behind major crashes included alcohol and substance abuse, reckless and negligent driving and unroadworthy vehicles.

Caro Smit, the director of South Africans Against Drunk Driving (SADD), said the evidential breathalyser, which has been piloted in Gauteng, should be introduced in KZN.
“In Gauteng the deaths went down, so we have to roll it out throughout the country,” Smit said. Karen Singh and Sakhile Ndlazi
