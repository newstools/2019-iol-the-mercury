Durban - Detectives are working around the clock to find four missing laptops taken during a robbery at a school in Upper Tugela earlier this month. 


Police have already arrested two men and recovered 14 laptops. 

KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said the men who are 18 and 20-years-old are due to appear in the Bergville Magistrate's Court on Monday. 


He said they face charges of housebreaking and theft charges. 


"They were arrested three days after they allegedly broke into a school at Upper Tugela in Bergville and stole laptops. It is alleged on January 14, the principal of a school at Upper Tugela opened a case of burglary after his school was broken into and 18 laptops were taken. Upper Tugela detectives began their investigation and activated their intelligence in the area," he said. 

Zwane said three days later, the police officers followed up information that lead to the recovery of 14 stolen laptops from the school. Two suspects were arrested and charged. 


He said detectives are still following up information on the four outstanding laptops that were taken from the school. 


"The arrested suspects will be profiled to establish if they are linked to any other burglary cases reported in the Upper Tugela area," Zwane said.
