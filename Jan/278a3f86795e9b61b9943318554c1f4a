Durban - In another step to help protect the environment of the Seychelles, the island nation’s Ministry of Environment will ban the importation of single-use plastic straws into the country as of February 1.
A total ban on straws will follow from June 1.

The ban will include straws used in cocktails and other drinks but will exempt plastic straws attached to juice packets, said a top official.
“The ban on plastic single-use straws will be implemented in phases,” said Nanette Laure, the director general at the waste enforcement and permit division at the Environment Ministry.
She said a total ban meant that no individual or company would be able to import, sell, process or manufacture plastic straws in the Seychelles.

It is not clear if there is any company producing straws in the country, however, manufacturing was included in the policy so as to cover all aspect of such a ban.
One type of straw to be exempted from the ban would be those found on small packets of juice and milk.
“We understand the concerns of other partners and NGOs on the use of straws that come with juice packets. Looking at all the factors, we will need to do the ban in phases as straws on juice packs fall in another category, but this does not mean that it won’t be banned,” said Laure.

It was in June last year that the Minister of Environment announced that a ban would be implemented on plastic straws. The announcement coincided with World Environment Day. A few days later, the cabinet of ministers approved the ban.
