Durban - Provincial Government departments have been dispatched to UMkhanyakude district for a crisis meeting, following a severe storm that devastated the area on Saturday.
UMkhanyakude District Municipality spokesperson Mduduzi Dlamini said key government departments, including Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), Social development and Home Affairs, are to meet today to assist those affected by the storm.

He said in the Umhlabuyalingana area, the storm had caused damage in three different wards, while 167 houses had been damaged in Jozini. 
“We are still busy counting the cost of the damage but the areas of Jozini and Umhlabuyalingana are the most hard hit, with people losing their belongings, including identification documents,” said Dlamini.
Cogta said in its statement that a person was fatally struck by lightning, while family members suffered severe burns and had to be treated by emergency services.

“The damage was extensive, there are some families that need to be placed in the community hall because of the damage on their homes. We will provide them with most things, including food,” said Dlamini. 
Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said she had dispatched disaster management teams to the area. 
“Our teams are on the ground and doing their best to respond.

“The severe thunderstorms swept through parts of uMkhanyakude District, at around 6pm on Saturday and tore off roofs, flooding houses and rendering some households in accessible,” she said.
“We are also asking neighbours and friends to help in linking our teams to those who urgently need assistance. We are making every effort to mitigate the impact of this disaster on those affected” said Dube-Ncube. 
She said Cogta has been in touch with the district mayor of uMkhanyakude, Solomon Mkhombo to co- ordinate the responses.
