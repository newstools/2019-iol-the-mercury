Durban - The shutdown of the Unisa campuses entered its second day yesterday as negotiations broke down and hundreds of prospective students were left stranded.
The students that camped out at the Durban campus yesterday went home after they were told they would not be registered. By 10am yesterday, a small group of about 100 people remained outside the gates, still hoping.

All Unisa campuses in KwaZulu-Natal are closed as part of a national shutdown. Student leaders are locked in a battle with management, who they accuse of failing to address student demands.
These include the blocking of students from registering, withholding results and failure to provide laptops and cash vouchers for books as per agreement with the institution.
Unisa, however, said some of these concerns had been addressed and others were not their mandate.

Lungi Nhlenyama, chairperson of the KZN SRC, said there was no end in sight for the strike. She said the management were not being honest about some of the issues being addressed.
“The most painful thing is that there are students coming from very far places such as Manguzi (northern KZN) that had hired transport hoping they would be able to register, but that did not happen.
“There are thousands of students at the Durban campus alone that slept there, hoping they might be able to register, and it was the same at other campuses,” she said. 

Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela said university management and the national SRC failed to reach an agreement yesterday. 
“Registration is, however, continuing online and will close on January 25. At the moment, we do not see the academic programme being affected,” he said.
