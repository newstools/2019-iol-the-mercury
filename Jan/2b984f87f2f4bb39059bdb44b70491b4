DURBAN - Preparations to demolish the Bank of Lisbon building in Joburg, which was engulfed in flames in September leading to the deaths of three firemen, were under way yesterday.

“We are still doing the preparations. The staff’s belongings that were inside still need to be removed, so it might take place between April and June,” said Kahn.
Spokesperson for Johannesburg Emergency Management Services Robert Mulaudzi said investigations into the cause of the fire were near completion.
