DURBAN - Durban Mayor Zandile Gumede says no schools will have their water and electricity disconnected even if their municipal accounts were in arrears.
Speaking at a recent executive committee meeting, Gumede said when the issue arose last year she met Department of Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane and came to an agreement that no matter the situation, it would not disconnect its municipal services. 

She also encouraged schools which have experienced disconnections to water and electricity supply to alert the municipality immediately so services could be reconnected and a payment plan arranged. 
“It is very mischievous of those principals to go to the media before engaging us. 
“When I met the MEC last year, we took the decision that disconnections at schools will never happen,” she said.

On Monday, the Mercury reported that some school principals raised concerns that they might be forced to close their schools this week after municipal officials threatened to disconnect the water and electricity due to non-payment by the Department of Education.
One principal said a municipal official told him last Friday that the school owed around R90000 to the municipality for services rendered.
After meeting department officials this week, a school official said he was informed there was an issue with the department’s Basic Accounting System.

“We were told the system crashed shortly before the department closed for the festive season. It was only rectified this month and that was probably the reason for the delay in payment,” the official said.
Dlungwane’s spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said the department was investigating the schools’ municipal accounts to determine why payments were not made to the municipality.
“As far as we can tell, no school was disconnected,” Mthethwa said.
