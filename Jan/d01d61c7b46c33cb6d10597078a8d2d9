DURBAN - The two men accused of the murder of Umbilo businessman Kidesh Ramjettan abandoned their bail applications in the Durban Magistrate’s Court yesterday.
Advocate Jimmy Howse, acting for the men, told the court that his clients had instructed him not to proceed with their bail application.

When asked by the magistrate if he was suggesting the suspects had been abandoning their bail, Howse responded that he was acting per his client's request. He requested the State to finalise its investigations as soon as possible.
The State asked for the matter to be postponed until February 28 for further information.
Ramjettan, 37, a father of one, was shot at his petrol station in Rossburgh last August while standing outside talking a customer. The shooting was captured on CCTV and widely circulated on social media.  

Trigger man, Ayanda Shezi was arrested two months later where Shezi pleaded guilty to the murder.
He is currently serving a life sentence in prison.
