Durban - There were tears and cries of joy when 300 newly recruited nurses and nursing assistants were welcomed into public service at Grey’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg yesterday.
The hiring of the medical staff - who are made up of 150 enrolled nurses and 150 enrolled nursing assistants - forms part of a stimulus package announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa to boost the health sector through the creation of more than 5300 jobs throughout the country.

Among the nursing assistants hired was Nompumelelo Majola, who had spent 13 years looking for permanent employment.
A week ago, on the day of her mother’s funeral, Majola got the call to inform her that she had been hired.
“I could not believe it. I’d like to thank President Cryil Ramaphosa and MEC Dhlomo for making our dreams come true,” she said. 

Fighting back tears, an emotional Gugu Mdlalose, from KwaMashu, who was placed at Wentworth Hospital, said: “This was going to be my 14th year of not working since qualifying as a nurse.”
Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo said it was good knowing that 300 families now had breadwinners. 
“We hope that by hiring 300 of them we are going to make a change and bring meaning in terms of quality of service to our people.”

Dhlomo added that the province would soon be announcing the employment of porters (160 posts), general orderlies (160 posts), pharmacy assistants (50 posts) and artisans (15 posts), who would also be employed as part of the stimulus package.
