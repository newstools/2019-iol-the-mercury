Festivities have been planned for much of the week in KwaZulu-Natal. In a statement, the party said it remained committed to realising a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic, and prosperous society. The ANC was founded on January 8, 1912. 
With 2019 being an election year, the party said it would use the January 8 celebrations rally to unveil it’s ‘People’s Manifesto’, which seeks to renew the democratic mandate to take South Africa forward, it said.

Despite calls made ANC Veterans’ League president, Snuki Zikalala, for Zuma to removed from ANC activities until he is cleared of corruption charges, the former president appeared in high spirits during the celebrations in Inanda.
