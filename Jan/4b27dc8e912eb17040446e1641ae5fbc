PARIS - Singer, dancer and actor Chris Brown said on Tuesday a rape allegation against him was false, a day after the French prosecutor’s office said he had been arrested in Paris with two other suspects.
Brown, a US citizen, had been released from police custody as authorities were still investigating the case, the French prosecutor’s office added. 

The arrests were first reported by Closer magazine, which said Brown, his bodyguard and a friend were detained after a 24-year-old woman alleged she was raped at the singer’s suite at the Mandarin Oriental hotel on the night of January 15. 
She said she met the men at a Paris nightclub earlier in the evening. 
“I wanna make it perfectly clear this is false,” Brown said in a post on his Instagram account. “For my daughter and my family, this is so disrespectful and is against my character and morals.” 

Brown, 29, pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna, then his girlfriend, in 2009, an incident that made headlines around the world.
