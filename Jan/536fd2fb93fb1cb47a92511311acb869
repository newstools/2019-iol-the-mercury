DURBAN - Hours after a DA-branded vehicle went missing from Morningside, party members were able to recover the ­vehicle with the help of residents and social media.
Zwakele Mncwango, the DA KZN’s Premier candidate, said that after the vehicle was stolen early yesterday morning, they immediately launched an appeal across social media platforms requesting help in locating it.

“The party wishes to extend its gratitude to the anonymous caller who gave us a lead as to the whereabouts of the vehicle, leading to its recovery,” said Mncwango.
However, he said, the DA was concerned and disappointed by the police’s poor response to the matter.
“After we reported the matter to the police and made a public appeal on social media, we received an anony­mous call alerting us to its location.

“Despite notifying the police of this development, they did not act and were not on the scene when the vehicle was recovered,” said Mncwango.

DA PR councillor Sithembiso Ngema, who reported to the police that the vehicle had been stolen from his residence, said that when he went to the police for the second time with the lead and asked for “backup”, they said it was probably a scam.

He said he, Mncwango, councilor Heinz de Boer and private security officers went to Avoca Hills to meet the man who had spotted the vehicle, and he directed them to where itwas parked.
“I called the police and told them that we recovered the vehicle and that we needed the investigating officer to come and sign the documents for it to be towed away,” said Ngema.
He said they waited for 45 minutes for the SAPS, who failed to arrive.
