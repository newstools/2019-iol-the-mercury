DURBAN - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa), the SA Post Office and the SAPS are investigating the source of a post on social media which advertised the sale of Sassa cards.
Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said the department was concerned.

“We are following leads that should result in the arrest of what seems to be the mastermind behind this scam,” said Letsatsi.
He said the stolen cards are sold for different amounts of money. The scam artist states in the post that he can provide a card in less than a week.
“You get a PIN linked to the card number and it gets activated three days after purchasing. Then you start earning your R400 or R1600 every month,” says the post.

His prices range from R600 to R1200, depending on the grant.
“The child grant card is R600 and pays R400 per month and the pensioners’ card is R1200 and pays R1600 per month.”
The Mercury messaged the man, posing as a potential buyer, but he only responded to ask where the buyer lived and did not answer follow-up questions.

Sassa acting chief executive, Abraham Mahlangu, said no grants can be drawn from the stolen cards and anyone buying them stands to lose out. If caught, buyers may also be charged with possession of stolen property.
“These stolen cards were immediately deactivated and are worthless,” he said.
“Sassa officials will never ask for money to issue a Sassa card. Beneficiaries are reminded to keep their pins secret and not to disclose their card and ID numbers at all,” said Letsatsi.

Beneficiaries should call Sassa on 0800601011 if they are offered any service relating to social grants for money, no matter how little the charge could be.
