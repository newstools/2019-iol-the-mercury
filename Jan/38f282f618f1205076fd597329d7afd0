DURBAN - Additional statements from witnesses have prolonged the release of a report into Professional Protective Alternatives’ conduct last month when the security firm allegedly removed people from Clifton Fourth Beach on December 23.
Their actions were followed by a string of protests by lobby groups and political parties who denounced the incident as racist.

The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (Psira) launched an investigation following the incident .
Psira’s acting chief executive Mmatlou Sebogodi thanked members of the public who came forward, saying their information had assisted the investigation. “We would like to urge members of the public to be patient as we intend to leave no stone unturned.”
PPA’s lawyer, Bruce Hendricks, said his client had complied with Psira.

“There are those who do not know the true story and they have different views. But there is more to it than meets the eye. We have footage of the night and, from that, it is clear they (security officers) were not in wrong.”
He said the video was handed over to Psira as part of their investigation and he hoped it would clear PPA.
