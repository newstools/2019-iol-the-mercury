It is believed that the man was part of a large crowd of people enjoying the sunshine and cool waters at the pool in Buffelsdale when tragedy struck. 
“We were told that the man had been pulled out of the water by a lifeguard. He was unresponsive. When RUSA officers arrived, CPR was being administered to the patient. Paramedics from three private ambulance services took over resuscitation efforts however attempts to revive the victim was unsuccessful and he was declared deceased at the scene,” Balram said.
He said the man’s family said the man has entered the water and was wearing a snorkel.
