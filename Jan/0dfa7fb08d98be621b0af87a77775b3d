DURBAN - The Department of Environmental Affairs says the fire season is not yet over, and has warned the public to be vigilant.
Working on Fire, a programme funded by the department, has deployed about 300 firefighters and pilots across South Africa to help control fires.

Firefighters deployed by Working on Fire have subdued four major fires in the Overberg municipal area in the past few weeks.The fires gutted 41 homes and damaged 28, and the cost from the damage is still being evaluated.
“The department would like to urge communities to be more vigilant during this fire season and not to start unnecessary fires, particularly during windy days this summer,” the department said.
“Communities are also asked to remove unnecessary rubble, which can pose a serious fire risk, from their properties, and houses next to grasslands need to ensure that there are sufficient fire breaks between their properties and these grasslands.

“We also request people to cut down overhanging tree branches close to their properties and to clean their gutters as leaves in gutters can also pose a fire risk. People should also ensure they have the contact details of their local fire authorities at hand.”
Extra care also had to be taken to clear invasive alien vegetation as they burn at very high temperatures when fanned by strong winds.
