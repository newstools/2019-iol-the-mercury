DURBAN - Three armed men have been arrested and jewellery worth about R40 000 recovered in Hillbrow, Johannesburg, Gauteng police said yesterday.
Police were searching for the other suspects, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said.

The jewellery was stolen when four armed suspects entered a shop at The Glen shopping mall on Thursday and pointed firearms at the staff.
“They loaded jewellery worth more than R300 000 in their bags and fled without firing any shots. No one was hurt during the robbery. Police are still questioning the suspects to establish the whereabouts and identity of their gang members, who are still at large,” Dlamini said.
Through crime intelligence and information from the community, police tracked down the suspects in Berea and recovered the jewellery.

The three suspects will appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court today.
