KwaZulu-Natal Regional Commissioner Mnikelwa Nxele said that all those who were found to be in possession of the contraband would be charged accordingly. Correctional Services spokesperson Thulani Mdluli said the purpose of the operation was to evoke security consciousness in officials, and the prevention of serious security-related incidents during the festive season.
“The December/January holiday period is, generally, a period during which inmates are desperate to escape for various reasons, which include, among others, participating in criminal activities or simply to be with family or friends.
“It is for this reason that special emphasis is placed on security measures in correctional centres, with increased visibility and involvement of managers at all levels in the operational activities.” 

Mdluli said past unannounced searches had yielded many illegal, dangerous weapons that were confiscated from inmates.
