DURBAN - The Department of Labour has set up a formal inquiry into the collapse of a structure that was under construction, which killed four people and left others injured in Durban last year.
The collapse occurred on March 28, on the premises of Imperial Logistics at 11 Milner Street in Jacobs.

Echo Prestress, a precast roofing company, was busy with the final installation of the concrete precast roof slab when the concrete structure collapsed.
Workers Bhekuyise Moses Sibiya, France Mokhuthu Sekalu, Constandino Mapukula and Siyabonga Bhane were killed. Four other employees were injured.
The department said the collapse had caused structural damage to an adjacent building, as well as to a heavy-duty vehicle that was stationary on the road.

“Subsequent to this, the Department of Labour’s inspectors issued a prohibition notice to Imperial Logistics, prohibiting any further work from being undertaken until the circumstances and root cause surrounding the collapse were investigated,” the department said.
The first session of the inquiry will be held from Monday to February 1. Sandile Kubeka, a specialist in occupational health and safety in the department, has been appointed as the presiding inspector and he will be assisted by forensic investigator Lennie Samuel, from the department’s Inspection and Enforcement Services branch.
A total of 18 witnesses have been lined up to testify before the commission. Additional witnesses may be called to testify based on information presented at the inquiry.
