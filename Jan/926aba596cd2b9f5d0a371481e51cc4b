DURBAN - The #10YearChallenge that has taken social media by storm, where people post pictures of what they looked like 10 years ago, has made rescued lions at animal welfare organisation Four Paws famous on Instagram.
Four Paws last week decided to launch its own campaign, highlighting the improvement in the condition of the lions which joined its Lionsrock Big Cat Sanctuary in Bethlehem, Free State.

It showcased lions that celebrated their 10-year anniversary at Lionsrock, and followers on Instagram couldn’t get enough of the uplifting content.
Fiona Miles, director of Four Paws in South Africa, said: “It’s incredible to see how much these animals have improved over the years - there’s a remarkable difference.
“From the anxious, underfed and abused image to something majestic again. This shows how animals flourish in a species-appropriate environment. The pictures had an engagement rate above 10%. The industry average for ‘good’ engagement levels was set around 6%.”

The photos Lionsrock published on its Instagram account had 16000 impressions on average.
“We were astounded by the reaction from followers and other Instagram users alike.
“This campaign not only showcased how much transformation can happen, but also why people shouldn’t support cub-petting and other practices that ultimately lead to the death or suffering of these majestic creatures. We should give them the lives they desperately deserve to have.”
