Durban - There is no rule that says you can't look fabulous while campaigning for your political party. And the ANC is no exception. 
On Tuesday, the ruling party's top officials took part in a number of events across the country, all celebrating the ANC's 107th anniversary. 

From Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte's newsprint fabric out to a range of other striking ANC regalia, including scarves, shirts and dresses.
