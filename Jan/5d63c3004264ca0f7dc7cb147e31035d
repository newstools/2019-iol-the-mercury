DURBAN - The Ministry of Energy says the deadline for public comments on the review of the Basic Fuel Price (BFP) Structure for Petrol, Diesel and Illuminating Paraffin is January 31. 
 

 A discussion document on the review was gazetted by Minister Jeff Radebe’s office two months ago.
The document serves to discuss the cost of petrol and paraffin, among other things. Radebe recently announced fuel prices had decreased and a litre of 93 petrol would now cost R1.22 less while 95 petrol would cost R1.23 less a litre.

Fuel prices were adjusted on a monthly basis informed by international and local factors.

  
 


He also last year announced new board members of Necsa. 

The factors that contributed to him dismissing the old board ranged from failing to comply with legislation, ignoring directives and instructions from the shareholder, mismanaging finances and undertaking unauthorised international travel.

Meanwhile, the Automobile Association (AA) believes further reductions in the fuel price are on the horizon at the end of the month.

The AA was commenting on unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund.
