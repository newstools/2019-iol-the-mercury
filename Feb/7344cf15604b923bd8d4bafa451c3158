DURBAN - The body of a missing boy was found a day after he drowned while he was crossing a river in Verulam.
Ntando Nkosi, 11, and his friends were on their way to play soccer when tragedy struck.

Reaction Unit SA spokesperson Prem Balram said that on Saturday morning Ntando and his friends were attempting to cross a river separating Temple Valley and Coniston when Ntando drowned.
Balram said when the unit arrived they were told that the youngsters were on their way to play soccer at the Verulam recreational grounds and had taken a short cut.
“Five of the friends managed to cross the river and two of the boys were separated from the group. But the water was quite deep and there was a strong current.

"One of the boys managed to grab on to a tree while his friend was dragged under,” Balram said.
Ntando’s grandmother, Nonhlanhla Nduku, said it was an emotional time for the family.
“Ntando’s mother has been crying since he went missing. She has not been able to sleep. My grandson loved soccer. We were told that his coach was meant to take the children but we were shocked to find out that they had to walk such a long distance. We need answers,” she said.
