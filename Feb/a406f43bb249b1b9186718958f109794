DURBAN - Children must go to school to learn and if there is an issue relating to how school fees are paid, that should be discussed with parents.
So said KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa, commenting on a protest by learners at the Temple Valley Secondary School in Verulam last week.

The pupils claimed they were dissatisfied with the school management and demanded the resignation of the principal.
Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) and the SAPS were called to the school after the protest took a violent turn. Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said that when they arrived, they found hundreds of children outside their classrooms.
“They were chanting Struggle songs, throwing stones and burning refuse bins,” said Balram, adding that Rusa and Verulam SAPS officers managed to calm the tense situation.

“According to students, they insisted that the principal be removed from the school after she demanded outstanding school fees,” said Balram.
Mthethwa said these issues should be dealt with at the level of the school governing body, the school management team and the parents.
He called for parents to get more involved in everything that was being done at school so they were aware of their children’s concerns.

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that pupils embarked on a protest and burned recycle bins.
Mbele said no case had been opened and no injuries had been reported.
