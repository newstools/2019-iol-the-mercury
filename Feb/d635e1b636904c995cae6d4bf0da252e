DURBAN - Durban's multi-award-winning International Convention Centre has clinched international conferences that will bring in more than 20000 delegates.
“And for every person attending a conference or exhibition at the Durban ICC, either as an exhibitor, delegate or visitor, there are positive economic spin-offs for local businesses,” said chief executive Lindiwe Rakharebe.
