DURBAN -  The Kwa-Zulu Natal Legislature 6 is being launched today in Pietermaritzburg. 
 

 Guests at the launch boasted former president Jacob Zuma, King Goodwill Zwelithini, KwaZulu-Natal social development MEC Weziwe Thusi and many more political heavyweights. 

 

 
  Speaking at the launch, 
  Zwelithini
   said, 
  "Both collectively and individually we need to ask ourselves a question. How can we make KZN a better and competitive province. 
  Agriculture and agri-business generally is the backbone of every civilised society the world over. As a province
  , we cannot manage to either outsource our food or be fully dependent on others to provide what is the most important commodity as a people. The costs of living have
   gone astronomically high. For us to live in these times, it will call for a new way of thinking." 
 

 

 Zwelithini further added, "I must further echo and support the president's words where he has been emphatic about turning South Africa into a garden of Eden. I believe now it's about time government ensures it drives a deliberate, more daring and a willing heart to invest in agriculture."
