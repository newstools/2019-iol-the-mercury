DURBAN - Durban North ward councillor Heinz de Boer has called on police to step up patrols around entertainment hotspots in the greater uMhlanga area.
De Boer was speaking after a dramatic shoot-out that claimed the life of a 38-year-old businessman at the weekend.

It is alleged that on Friday night, a fight broke out at a nightclub near Gateway. The dead man, Keegan Naidoo, had allegedly been contacted after one of his relatives was involved in an altercation. Naidoo arrived and is believed to have tried to calm the situation, but a scuffle ensued and the men drew firearms.
Naidoo was shot and rushed to a local hospital, where he died shortly after arrival. His funeral took place yesterday at Mount Edgecombe’s Shri Mariamman Temple.
De Boer said he had, on many occasions at Durban North SAPS executive meetings, called on police to actively patrol nightclubs, restaurants and entertainment areas.

“We have seen, over the past year, several violent altercations outside nightclubs and bars. And now we have a case where there was a shooting that claimed someone’s life. We urge police not to just look into the shooting, but also the licensing of these nightclubs,” he said.
De Boer said the incident seemed like a minor altercation that spiralled out of control, adding that it also reinforced the need for ongoing policing in places where alcohol was consumed.
De Boer also called on police to investigate whether the firearms were carried into the nightclub or if they were kept in vehicles - which in itself is illegal.

De Boer added that it was also important for the public to behave in a responsible manner.
“One cannot blame the club management or police. People must drink and act responsibly,” he said.
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that Durban North police were investigating a charge of murder and three more of attempted murder. She said three pistols were recovered at the scene.
