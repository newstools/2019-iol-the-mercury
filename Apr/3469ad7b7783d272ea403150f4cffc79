DURBAN - The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said the new Evidential Breathalyser Alcohol Test (Ebat) would play a “key role” in ensuring the speedy prosecution of drunk drivers this Easter.
This comes after the Ebat device was launched earlier this week by Transport Minister Blade Nzimande as part of the Easter holiday road safety programme, in Pietermaritzburg.

The device, which takes into account gender and age, determines the blood-alcohol level in a motorist’s body and eliminates the need for a blood sample to be sent for analysis.
RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said the Easter road safety plan would be implemented uniformly across all provinces. 
“The plan involves dealing with drunken driving, addressing corruption at motor vehicle testing stations, public transport, overloading, pedestrian safety and others.

“Ebat will play a key role in ensuring the speedy prosecution of drunk drivers,” said Zwane.
Caro Smit, the founder and director of South Africans Against Drunk Driving, said she was “absolutely thrilled that the Ebats have been launched”.
Smit said that the test was extremely accurate, and if found under the influence a person could go to court and be tried and sentenced within a week, depending on the court’s roll.
