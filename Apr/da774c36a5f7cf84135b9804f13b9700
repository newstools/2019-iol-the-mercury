DURBAN - Residents, living in Rockview Road in Amanzimtoti on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast, woke up to find a boundary wall, a garage and at least two-thirds of a house washed away on Tuesday morning. 
 

 Many parts of the province were left devastated by heavy rains that fell on Monday. 

 


 
 


 Jacques Coetzee, who spent most of his life in the now destroyed home, said he was alerted to what had happened by the neighbour. 

 

 
  
 
 

 

 
  
 
 

 

 "My mother now owns the house and we were renting it out to a man who lived in the outbuilding while he was doing up the rest of the house. It is just devastating," he said. 

 

 
  
 
 

 

 Nobody was injured from the house washing away.  
 A section of the roadway had also collapsed. Residents have blamed this on bad maintenance of the storm water and servitude pipes.
