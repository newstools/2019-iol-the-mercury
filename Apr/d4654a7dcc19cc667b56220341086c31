DURBAN - A father rescued his three children and his wife after a mudslide wiped out his two-bedroom house in the Mandela Park informal settlement in Marianhill this morning.
 This comes after heavy rain devastated several areas across Durban.

The man reportedly saw his family stuck in the mud and rushed to rescue them.

Rescue Care spokesperson Gareth Jamieson said paramedics declared a 15-year-old girl dead at the Wilshire road informal settlements after she was washed downstream in the early hours of the morning.
 “Three children were washed downstream by the mudslide and downpour that Durban felt and the community managed to save the two however the third young lady was recovered this morning and has unfortunately passed away,” said Jamieson.
An elderly resident living at the bottom of Umhlatuzana Road said she does not have any water after a water pipe washed away on Monday night.

“The tuck shop and the water pipe washed away. The owner of the shop was asleep when it happened and now I have no water because the pipe is broken,” she said.
