DURBAN - What started as a visit to Cape Town’s Two Oceans Aquarium turned into a commitment to protect turtles and penguins for 5-year-old Jenny Kenyon-Wimbush.
After hearing about the harmful effect plastic has on marine life, Jenny decided to start collecting it to make a difference to the environment.

With the help of her parents, she has collected about 160000kg of plastic, and aims to increase this to 200000kg before her birthday at the end of next month. 
Her mother, Katherine Kenyon, said they were proud of Jenny’s mission. 
“I am not sure if we will meet the goal in the next five weeks, but it all depends on people coming with stuff.” 

She said Jenny was inspired by her older brother Matthew, 12, who collected clothes and toys for less fortunate children.
Jenny sends the plastic to the Owl Rescue Centre, where it gets processed and converted into Owl and Bat boxes, as well as hives for migrating bees. 
To support Jenny’s cause by collecting plastic, contact her mother at 0783084755 or go to Facebook page: Jenny’s Journey: Helping Our Turtles And Penguins.
