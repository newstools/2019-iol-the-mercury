DURBAN - The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) has issued an email scam alert being used to collect personal information today.

 

 Dumisani Mavundla, the CCMA spokesperson said they have recently been made aware of emails being sent to our User’s from the admin@ccma.org.za email address.

 

 “It instructs the user’s to come into the CCMA’s Regional Offices for an “Arbitration”, it has a case number starting with GAJK. It has no branding nor watermarks. This email is fraudulent! It is a phishing scam to collect personal information,” said Mavundla. 

 

 He explained that the CCMA does send communication to users but the genuine email will come from different Case Management Officers (CMO’s) in the regions. 

 

 “The name will appear as a signature at the bottom of the email and all relevant information such as the contact details, office number and helpdesk number. Also there will be a CCMA logo and Watermarks,” said Mavundla. 

 

 Mavundla warned users not to entertain nor correspond with these fraudulent emails. 

 

 “The CCMA is working hard to removing this fraudulent email domain,” he said.
