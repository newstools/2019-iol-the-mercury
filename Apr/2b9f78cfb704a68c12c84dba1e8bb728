DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal’s top entrepreneurs were recognised at the 2019 Ithala Business Achievers Awards held in uMhlanga on Thursday night.
Among the winners were two top businesswomen, Nonduduzo Khanyile (formerly Kheswa) managing director of legal firm TKN Incorporated, who clinched the overall Entrepreneur of the Year Award and Bathabile Mpofu, founder of Nkazimulo Applied Science, who shared the winner’s platform as the overall Property Tenant Business of the Year. The pair beat 30 nominees to scoop the top awards, each winning R100 000 towards their business plus R10 000 for a charity of their choice.

Khanyile is the co-owner of TKN Incorporated, a 100% black-owned, women-led, law firm in Morningside, Durban, which has carved itself a place in the competitive legal sector.
Mpofu founded Nkazimulo Applied Science, which supplies portable science kits to previously disadvantaged schools, enabling pupils to perform experiments.
Speaking at the awards ceremony, Pearl Bengu, Ithala group chief executive, congratulated all the winners for the role they played in job creation in KZN.

“As a development finance corporation that aims to be a catalyst for economic development and empowerment, we initiated the Business Achiever Awards project to recognise and reward existing Ithala clients in their role of developing an entrepreneurial province.
“In selecting the finalists, we nominated those who epitomise a spirit of entrepreneurship, have a good track record of financial performance, have made an impact in their community and demonstrated innovation and integrity,” she said.
A panel of independent judges from the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry, eThekwini Municipality Business Support Unit and the SA Property Owners Association assessed the nominees and selected the winners on the basis of their business sustainability, growth, job creation, community development and entrepreneurial flair and innovation.
