DURBAN - Rescue teams are digging through the rubble of a Queensburgh home in search of a family of three, believed to have died when a house collapsed onto them on Monday night.

 

 Currently community members are working with the teams to locate the man, his wife and their young daughter. 

 

 A relative said he was horrified when he received a call informing him that his brother in law had died. 

 

 The family, originally from Malawi had been renting a room at the house for the last two years. 
 At least four more bodies were pulled from the rubble at the same house earlier. 

 Two people have been rushed to hospital.
