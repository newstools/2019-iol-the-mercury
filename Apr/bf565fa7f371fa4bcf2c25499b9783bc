Durban - The Independent Electoral Commision (IEC) has made arrangements for a special vote for Muslims as voting in the national elections coincides with the start of Ramadan.
Voting takes place on 8 May and the holy month of Ramadan starts around the same time.

 How to apply for a special vote at your voting station:
 If you can’t vote at your voting station on election day, you can apply to cast a special vote at your voting station on 6 or 7 May 2019 between 4 and 18 April 2019 only, as per the election timetable, in one of the following ways:


  Using our secured online application form


            https://www.elections.org.za/IECOnline/special-vote-online-application

 


 By SMSing your identity number to 32249 (R1.00 per SMS). (For special vote at a voting station ONLY)
 By visiting your local IEC office (not the national or provincial offices) and submitting a VEC 1 form. Forms can only be hand-delivered (no emails or faxes accepted), but someone else can deliver your completed form on your behalf.


 The IEC said applicants will receive an SMS notifying them of the outcome once an application has been processed.
 The status of your application can also be checked online.

 The IEC emphasised that voting must take place at the voting station where citizens are registered and applied for the special vote, either on 6 or 7 May 2019.
