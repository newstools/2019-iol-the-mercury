Durban - Popular house musician, Holly Rey, is set to graduate with an honours degree in Media and Communication Cum Laude, from the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) on Monday. 
Rey, real name Holly Wasserfall,is well-known for her hit songs, ‘Deeper’,  ‘Joy’, and ‘You’.

Holly’s research investigated the representation and decoding of gender-based inequality in Uzalo, South Africa’s most-watched soap opera. 
Uzalo is an interesting case study in this regards as the two families, initially headed by men, are now headed by women. 
“It is important to understand how these encoded messages of empowerment are decoded by audiences, to understand whether or not they are facilitating or challenging the gender-based inequalities prevalent in society; and as a result empowering women,” she explained.

The study is informed by the continued presence of gender-based inequality in forms such as gender-based violence, femicide and uneven pay in South Africa.
“Gender expectations differ from society to society and although patriarchy power structures dominate in most societies globally, the manifestations of these power structures may vary. My research concerns itself with the Zulu culture,” she said.
