DURBAN - Two homeless men, living on a concrete slab situated in the middle of a canal in Clairwood, had to be rescued on Tuesday morning. 
 

 In the dramatic rescue, emergency crews had to use a crane to get the men off the structure and safely back on land. 

 

 It is believed that four men live on the structure and upon noticing that the waters were rapidly rising, two decided to swim to safety. 

 

 However, according to those at the scene, two men opted to stay on the structure. 

 

 eThekwini Fire Regional commander, Sbu Mkhulisi, said when teams arrived, they managed to get the men to safety using a crane. 

 

 However, reports from the scene indicate that one of the men refused to leave his bag and when he was eventually coerced to get onto the crane with his bag, police found cables, which were allegedly stolen from another area. 

 

 The man was promptly arrested by police at the scene.
