DURBAN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal has rejected a proposal by the eThekwini Municipality for a ‘Liberation Route’ seminar that will cost ratepayers almost R1 million. 

 

 They believe that the proposal, brought by the Parks, Recreation and Culture Unit, was nothing more than an ANC function paid for by ratepayers. 

 

 “Whilst the DA takes no issue with honoring the history of the country, there is a clear difference between party political events and events that should be paid for by the public, DA caucus leader Nicole Graham said.

 

 She said financial amounts are allocated for honorariums to be paid to ‘various icons and artists including Zuma. 

 

 “This was amended verbally by Parks Head Thembinkosi Ngcobo, who claimed the disgraced former President was ‘priceless’ and did not want to be paid,” Graham said.

 

 The event is meant to celebrate 25 years of democracy and is believed to cost R960 000. After a 10 minute argument between the the DA and meeting chairperson, the DA left the meeting.
