DURBAN - Berea police yesterday arrested a 23-year-old man wanted in connection with the murder of Durban University of Technology student adviser Dr Euvette Taylor, who was found murdered in his room in February.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the arrest.

It is believed police had received information of the man’s whereabouts and found him in Magwaza Maphalala (Gale) Street yesterday.
He was arrested and is detained at Berea police station. Zwane said he was expected to appear in court today.
On February 11, Taylor’s body was found in his room by campus security guards. They went to check Taylor’s room after a person known to him expressed concern that she had not heard from him that day.

The suspect is also believed to have been involved in the fatal stabbing of an elderly man in a Musgrave complex last month.
It is alleged that the accused and the 61-year-old’s adopted son had an argument and he tried to intervene.
