DURBAN - Seasonal control measures are in place to prevent African horse sickness (AHS) in the Western Cape.
Last week, the provincial Department of Economic Opportunities said the Western Cape Veterinary Services, in conjunction with South African Equine Health and Protocols (SAEHP), had focused efforts to enable equine exports from the province.

Economic Opportunities spokesperson Bianca Capazorio said that as part of this drive, the Western Cape had initiated further measures to ensure the integrity of the AHS-controlled areas.
“AHS is endemic to South Africa, and the Western Cape control zones are of vital importance in protecting the province’s equine export market,” Capazorio said. 
Economic Opportunities MEC Beverley Schäfer said the movement restrictions into the Western Cape were an example of successful control systems at work in protecting the integrity of local AHS-controlled zones.

“By unlocking equine exports we will be able to grow a valuable sector of our agricultural economy,” she said.
Schäfer appealed to all horse owners to comply with all the movement control regulations. 
The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, provincial government and SAEHP were committed to maintaining compliance with international disease control standards and creating a sustainable equine export market, Schäfer added.
