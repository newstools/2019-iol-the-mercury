DURBAN - Local government expert and former eThekwini municipal manager Michael Sutcliffe said while he was at the city, the disaster management department seemed to cope well.
He highlighted the 2010 World Cup as one event where a sound disaster management plan was essential.

“I think we coped very well. Once the new centre was created for the World Cup it made things much easier, and many municipalities, provinces and even national government came to learn from us (just as we learnt from them). 
“We also had challenges, such as fire ladders that don’t reach the highest floors of all buildings in the city, but continually upgraded our processes and resources. I was really proud of our team.
“I don’t know what the quality of the leadership competencies in disaster management is now, but we had a great team. 

“That is why the World Cup was successful, because we mitigated possible challenges and ensured we were ready for all possibilities.”
He said all municipalities were part of the provincial and then national disaster management plans. 
However, not all municipalities would have the requisite resources and competencies.

“Disaster management means a continuous and integrated multi- sectoral, multidisciplinary process of planning and implementation of measures aimed at preventing or reducing the risk of disasters; mitigating the severity or consequences of disasters; emergency preparedness; a rapid and effective response to disasters, and post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation.”
