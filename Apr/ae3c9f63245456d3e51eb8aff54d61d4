 Many people in the mob seemed to be vagrants who then began looting stuff from the bus and cars. The mob made off with a ladder and gutter pipes from the back of bakkie caught in the traffic.

  

 Sfiso Shangase, SANTACO spokesperson, said it was not their association members involved in the protest. 

 

 Parboo Sewpersad, a Durban Metro police spokesperson, said police taxi owners were having a dispute with the NPA. 

 

 This is a developing story.
