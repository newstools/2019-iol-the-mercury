DURBAN - Advertising agency Ogilvy Durban’s digital capabilities catapulted into global leadership territory with the launch of Social.Lab in South Africa.
The Lab was introduced to Durban clients at a seminar last week.

Ogilvy SA said it had integrated Social.Lab into the agency’s broader offering. “Our clients’ use of social media is maturing from primarily organically driven activities to mass media buys and a direct driver of commercial goals,” said Ogilvy Durban managing director John Gale. 
“Social.Lab gives us access to leading insights and social media practices through propriety tools, experience, and an experimental mindset. Working with the likes of some global brands such as Phillips, Nespresso, and IKEA, Social.Lab is at the heart of this evolving business model which will be of direct benefit to our clients,” said Gale.
Christophe Chantraine, based at Ogilvy Cape Town, heads up the 18-strong Social.Lab team in the country. 

Social.Lab in South Africa is set up differently from the rest of the world because here it includes all digital media buying across social media.
“I’ve seen great potential in Durban,” said Chantraine. “With a mix of clients - including consumer goods, media, and lead generation - there’s a lot of scope for us to add real value to Ogilvy Durban’s offering.
“We’ve created a flexible model to enhance, rather than restrict the way we work,” he said. “This way we can make the most of dynamic digital opportunities.”
