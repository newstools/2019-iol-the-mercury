DURBAN - A human skull found in the Kruger National Park is believed to be that of a man reportedly killed by an elephant while poaching, Mpumalanga police say.
“The police received information that some men had gone poaching in the park on April 1, when suddenly an elephant attacked and killed one of them,” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said. “His accomplices claimed to have carried his body to the road so that passers-by could find it in the morning. They then vanished from the park,” he said.

They then reportedly informed a relative of the dead man about their ordeal and the police were alerted. 
A search operation was launched by police and rangers, during which the skull and pieces of clothing were found.
The police then launched a joint, intelligence-driven operation in search of the dead poacher’s accomplices, resulting in the arrest of three men within the KaMhlushwa and Komatipoort policing precincts. The men were aged between 26 and 35.

During the operation, two .375 hunting rifles and ammunition were seized.
The suspects had briefly appeared in the Komatipoort Magistrate’s Court on Friday on charges of possession of firearms and ammunition without a licence, conspiracy to poach and trespassing. They were remanded in custody and would appear in the same court on April 12, for a formal bail application. 
An inquest docket was opened in connection with the dead suspect, Hlathi said.
