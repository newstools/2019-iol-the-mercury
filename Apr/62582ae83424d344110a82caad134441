INTERNATIONAL - A group of young scientists, including two from KwaZulu-Natal, are representing South Africa at the 2019 Kenya Science and Engineering Fair, the oldest science fair on the continent.
The pupils are attending the fair in Nairobi between April 7 and 12 after being selected to represent South Africa at the Eskom Expo.

“Eskom Expo continues to provide a platform and opportunities for young scientists to showcase their talents as part of the national initiative of South Africa,” said executive director Parthy Chetty.
“In the past, our learners have always enjoyed their stay and experiences in Kenya, as they exchange stories of their different cultures, experiences and environments.”
The students have undertaken scientific research into a water treatment system, a solar powered umbrella and completed a study into the differences between privileged and underprivileged children.

The group comprises Siphesihle Sithole, from Mehlokazulu High in Pietermaritzburg; Ntendeni Nephawe, from Mbilwi Secondary school in Vhembe; Caroline Boshoff from Cape Recife in Port Elizabeth; and Norman Mashiri from Dr Joseph Shabalala in Ladysmith.
The Nairobi fair offers pupils an opportunity to present their research to their peers from other countries, while promoting cross-cultural communication and educational exchange.
