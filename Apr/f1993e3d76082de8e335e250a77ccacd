DURBAN - A crew of six men had to be rescued yesterday morning when their fishing boat capsized near the Silt Canal in the Durban port.
National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson Craig Lambinon said a sea rescue craft was launched.

“An SAPS diver accompanied by metro police search and rescue, KwaZulu-Natal Health EMS, eThekwini Fire and Rescue Services and Netcare 911 paramedics were dispatched to the scene. They found a private fishing ski-boat with two men on board had assisted the crew who were in the water near the hull of their capsized boat,” he said.
The capsized boat was towed to the pier.
Lambinon said all six men were accounted for on the private ski boat.

“The private fishing ski-boat then departed to go fishing while NSRI assisted the six men. They were medically checked by paramedics and found to be suffering minor injuries but they required no further medical care.”
Lambinon said the police divers attached lines to the casualty boat and it was righted and recovered and no further assistance was required.
“We commend the two fishermen who rescued the crew of six men. We also commend the SAPS and metro divers for their assistance,” Lambinon said.
