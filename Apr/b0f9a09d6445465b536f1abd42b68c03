DURBAN - Several people have been treated for smoke inhalation following a fire at a building in the Durban Central Business District on Wednesday morning. 
 

 Rescue Care spokesperson, Garrith Jamieson, said they were called to the scene just before 9am at the intersection of Denis Hurley (
 Queen) Street and Dr Yusuf Dadoo (Grey) Street. 

 

 "Three stores and some apartments were damaged in the fire. The fire was extinguished by the fire department officials who worked quickly to contain the blaze. The roads around the fire were closed to traffic while the teams worked to dampen down the building. We advise motorists to avoid the area.
