DURBAN - A Durban primary school principal has been suspended following allegations of sexual harassment, intimidation, assault and financial mismanagement. He allegedly threatened to kill staff if they ever reported him.
On Tuesday morning, the MEC for Education in KwaZulu-Natal, Mthandeni Dlungwane, visited the school and spoke to teachers and staff. 

Dlungwane confirmed that the principal had been suspended. He said the principal arrived at school in the morning but later left. 
Dlungwane said he refused to speak to teachers in the presence of the principal and waited for him to leave before he had his meeting. 
Police confirmed that a case has been opened at the Umbilo SAPS for further investigation. At this stage, the docket has been handed to the  SAPS Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Investigations Unit for further processing and investigation. 

At least 15 teachers met with the MEC to address their grievances. 
A source revealed that the principal allegedly asked one of the staff members to photograph herself while she was in the toilet and then tell him how she felt. 
Dlungwane said the Department of Education in KZN will be investigating the matter further. He said they have to follow due processes and an acting principal will be appointed to ensure the smooth running of the school.
