DURBAN - The 2019 Lilizela Tourism Awards, which recognise service excellence and the “best of the best” in the hospitality industry, opened for entries this week.
Sihle Zikalala, the MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, has expressed hope that there will be more entries from the province.

“We would like to see an increase in the number of KZN businesses entering this year, particularly among the emerging sector, as these are important high-profile awards and businesses that do well reap the rewards in recognition and publicity,” he said.
“We would also like to see entries come from around the province and not just the main centres.
“We know there are potential worthy winners in all sectors of the tourism sector out there and we want them to get the recognition they deserve.

“Their contribution helps grow tourism’s contribution to the GDP, creates jobs and contributes to South Africa’s global competitiveness.”
The Lilizela Tourism Awards, hailed as the “Oscars’’ of the industry, are an initiative of the national Department of Tourism. While it was a national competition, there would be a special awards ceremony for provincial finalists and winners, said Zikalala. These winners will go to the national finals in Joburg.
Last year KZN winners took home nine top honours. Phindile Makwakwa, acting chief executive of Tourism KZN, said: “We had 185 entries last year. It would be great if we could reach the 200 mark ths year.”
