DURBAN -
 Â More than 100 homeless people gathered at the Denis Hurley Centre on Thursday morning to engage in a dialogue with local politicians and the issue of homelessness ahead of the national elections set for May 8.

 

 For several years, the issue of homelessness has plagued the city of Durban and on Thursday those living on the streets were able to meaningfully engage with politicians.

 

 IFP representative, TJ Gumede, called for local government to build centres to help those living on the streets. She said these centres need to be partially administrated by churches and NGOs.

 

 The DA' Nicole Graham unpacked the party's plan to fight corruption and better educate and equip those living on the streets.

 

 Her comments to better secure the borders of SA were quickly rebutted by the EFF's Vusi Khoza who called for the idea of borders to be scrapped.
