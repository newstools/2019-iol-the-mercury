Durban - THE search for missing St Augustine’s nurse entered Day 14 on Wednesday. The i
 ntensive care unit nurse Sushie Govender, 50, of Arena Park, Chatsworth, was last seen on Wednesday, March 20, at Reunion Beach near Isipingo, two weeks ago.

 

 Last weekend, Govender’s family and Isipingo based private security company, PT Alarms, performed extensive searches in the hopes to find any new information. 
 PT Alarms’ Dhevan Govindsamy said that over the weekend they searched for the mother of two at the request of her husband, Rogers Govender.  

 

 “We had sniffer dogs, extensive combs of the area and an aerial search with our helicopter but the searches yielded nothing new,” said Govindsamy.  

 

 Govender’s younger brother, Megan Palthas, said that it has been an “unbearable time” for the family. 

 

 “I don’t think that the family will ever completely heal. She would want us to live our lives but the pain is still fresh and it will always be there,” said Palthas.

 

 Her eldest son Diveshan Govender, said he was grateful for the support from all those who have offered their assistance in the search. He said the family would not stop searching. 

 

 “We will never give up hope, we’re all taking it one day at a time. We need answers, we don’t have any closure knowing that there are so many unanswered questions,” said Govender. 

 

 Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel 
  Thulani Zwane said investigations ongoing and the search would continue.
