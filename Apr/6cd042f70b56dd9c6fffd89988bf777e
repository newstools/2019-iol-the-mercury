DURBAN - Three trucks were set alight in alleged attacks at the weekend.
On Saturday a truck was burnt near the Southway Container depot in Durban, and another was burnt on the M7. Yesterday a truck was torched near Howick at midday.

This comes after several attacks on trucks in the past few months, allegedly by local truck drivers who are unhappy about the employment of foreigners as truck drivers.
Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said a truck was burnt near Howick, and a protest related to the truck drivers’ grievances was held in Pietermaritzburg near Chota Motala Road yesterday.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said they were investigating a case of damage to property. He said the truck driver said he was “forced out of the truck by three unknown men”.

“He saw the truck burning and the men fled in their bakkie,” said Zwane.
Meanwhile, it was reported on the SA Trucker website that a truck driver had been burnt, while another escaped harm in separate incidents in Durban on Saturday night.
It is alleged that the driver was woken from his sleep by the breaking of his truck window while sleeping just outside Southway Container depot at about 2am on Saturday morning. A petrol bomb was thrown inside the truck and he sustained serious injuries.

The website said that earlier on Saturday, a petrol bomb had been thrown at a truck on the M7; the truck was burnt but the driver escaped unharmed.
