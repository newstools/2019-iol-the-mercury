DURBAN - A group of about 250 policemen and women from stations around Durban took to the streets on Monday morning to express their dissatisfaction with 'unfair promotions' within the force.

 

 The march has been organised by a group calling themselves SAPS Concerned Members.

 

 The group say they have yet to be addressed by police national minister, Bheki Cele.

 

 In March police officers raised concern at the manner in which promotions were being decided upon.

 

 They claim that those within the police force with years of experience are being overlooked while those in elite policing units are swiftly moved up the ranks.
