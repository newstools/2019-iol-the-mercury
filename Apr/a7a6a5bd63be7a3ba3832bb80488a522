LONDON - Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher apparently got by on four or five hours’ sleep a night.
But it seems they set far from an ideal example. Experts said that thinking we needed only five or fewer hours was one of the most harmful myths about sleep. 

Regularly managing on four or five hours increased the risk of heart attacks, strokes and early death, according to a study on the 20 most common myths about sleep by US researchers.
They searched more than 8000 websites, news reports and scientific publications. Dr Rebecca Robbins, who led the study from New York University School of Medicine, said: “We have extensive evidence to show that (too little) sleep increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences.”
The study, published in the journal Sleep Health, also offers advice to those struggling to nod off and says they should get up and do something that is not stressful.
