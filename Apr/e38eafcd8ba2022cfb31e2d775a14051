DURBAN - Severely polluted and muddy waters raged along Durban's coastline as residents brace themselves for another storm expected this evening. 

 

 Most noticeable was the Umgeni river mouth spewing heavily polluted water into the ocean at Blue Lagoon. An aerial view of Durban, from Reaction Unit South Africa's helicopter, did not paint the usual pretty picture of the city. 

 

 Collapsed banks, damaged rooftops of buildings and houses, water-logged sports grounds and fields and flooded roads could be seen. 

 

 The Mercury was flown from Verulam, north of Durban to Chatsworth in the south. 

 

 A hawks-eye view shows that Durban south was hit the hardest by the raging storms on Monday night. 

 

 Umhlatuzana river could be seen gushing along while a number of residents living along the river banks could be seen cleaning up their back yards. 

 

 Only a portion of the newly renovated Umhlatuzana Temple could be seen from the chopper as it was significantly damaged in the early hours of Tuesday morning. 

 

 In the north, Director of Reaction Unit South Africa Prem Balram flew over the Hazelmere dam that was filled to its brim.
