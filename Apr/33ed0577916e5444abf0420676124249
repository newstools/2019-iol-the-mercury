Durban - A one-year-old baby has drowned at the Umkomazi River when her mother slipped while attempting to cross the river. The KwaZulu-Natal mother was crossing the river with her baby and a three-year-old child when she slipped.
The three-year-old child has been airlifted to hospital by the KZN Department of Health’s air ambulance helicopter to a provincial hospital. 
KZN emergency medical services spokesperson Robert McKenzie said the mother had called for help from members of the community when she slipped.
“She called for assistance and community members, including a minibus driver and sisters from the nearby Banyeni Clinic came to their assistance,” he said. 
McKenzie said the three were taken to the clinic, while paramedics, police and firefighters responded at the scene. The baby was declared dead at the local clinic.

“The children were examined at the clinic, sadly the 14-month-old was found to be decreased. The three-year-old was treated at the clinic by the facilities medical staff and paramedics before being airlifted to hospital by the department of health's air ambulance,” said McKenzie.
