OPINION - Julius Malema, the high-flying comrade with expensive tastes, and his wife are now members of one of South Africa’s most exclusive, prestigious and elitist institutions, Inanda Club in Sandton. 
 

 They have access to sports and dining facilities that us ordinary folks will never afford. 

 

 The Malemas can now join like-minded individuals to enjoy business, sport and social networking in high-class Sandton. This is a short distance from their smart house in Hyde Park, rented to them courtesy of tobacco tycoon Adriano Mazzotti.
Malema the Gucci Revolutionary enjoys the good and expensive life, from his exclusive Breitling watch to his high-end designer clothing. The irony of Bling 

King Julius is that he’s very critical of elitism, but has abandoned his people in the townships and joined the mostly white elite. His faithful fascist followers are blinded by his hateful rabble-rousing and that of his lieutenants about the poor black child he once was. 

Your grown-up Malema is a coconut. Viva capitalism, viva VBS Bank, viva EFF, as your commander in chief becomes king of all he surveys and desires. 

If the EFF working class don’t have cake, let them eat their hard hats and overalls. It’s Champagne and caviar for King Julius.
