DURBAN - A large fountain of water, which reached about 20m high, poured from a water pipe in Shallcross yesterday after thieves stole an air valve cover.
Shallcross ward councillor Prevan Vedan said the theft affected a pipe in Vindhya Street at 3.30pm.

He said municipal workers were already in the area and had managed to send a plumber “quite quickly”.
“When the plumber arrived he did not have the capacity to contain the gushing water and had to call a contractor to assist,” said Vedan.
He added that the issue was resolved before 5pm.

Meanwhile, despite reports of flooding on some roads in Durban last night including the KwaMashu Highway in the vicinity of Bridge City, the SA Weather Service said no storm warning had been issued for last night or for the Easter weekend.
“There is no heavy or severe rain, and in terms of the long weekend no rain is predicted for Friday (tomorrow). On Saturday there will be a 30% to 60% chance of rain,” said forecaster Ayanda Ntsele. 
Ntsele added that while there was a possibility of heavy rainfall on Sunday, it was too early to tell if there would be a storm.

Senzo Mzila, a Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesperson, said the department had not received a heavy rain warning from the weather service.
“But we do advise drivers to take precautions on the roads because weather conditions could change,” said Mzila.
