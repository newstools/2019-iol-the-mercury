DURBAN - A move to improve the lives of livestock farmers in KwaZulu-Natal will be made at a meeting of farmers in the Tongaat Town Hall today.
MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development Themba Mthembu will be the keynote speaker at the summit, which started at 9am.

Livestock Farming is a form of farming that has been practised by communities in rural areas for generations and has played a major role in creating food security for small-scale farmers, said Phathisa Mfuyo, spokesperson for the department.
“MEC Mthembu, through this summit, wants to promote livestock associations, build auction facilities and abattoirs to assist livestock farmers, especially in rural areas,” she said.
With the theme “Commercialising communal livestock to unlock hidden wealth in the value chain”, the summit aims to come up with resolutions which will make livestock farming thrive in KwaZulu-Natal and better the lives of livestock farmers, especially in rural areas, she added.
