Johannesburg - With a week left before South Africans take to the polls, the Institute of Race Relations’ (IRR) latest poll shows the ANC sitting at 49.5% of the national voter share with the  DA at 21.3% and the EFF at 14.9%.
Gareth van Onselen, the IRR’s head of politics and governance, said on Tuesday that the poll was not a prediction of the voting outcome for elections next Wednesday. 

The institute had published three other polls gathered from interviews with voters on their possible voting intentions. This latest poll was conducted between April 18 and April 25.

Van Onselen, said voting patterns were likely to change with the next few days as voters make final decisions. 
“It is important to appreciate that this poll came out of the field with 14 days of the election period still to go. The last weeks of an election campaign are a critical period during which, historically, the bigger parties – particularly the ANC and DA – tend to consolidate their vote upwards, and the vote share of smaller parties declines, as their voters are pressured. This is still likely to happen,” van Onselen said.
