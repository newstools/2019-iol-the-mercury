DURBAN - Where is Mayor Zandile Gumede? This is the question being asked by Democratic Alliance Caucus Leader in eThekwini, Nicole Graham. 

 

 Graham said Gumede failed to attend Executive Committee and council meetings held last week. 

 

 “The mayor submitted leave on Tuesday and claimed that she was ill. However, she was present to cut the ribbon at a store opening in Cornubia and by looking at the photographs, the mayor looked happy and well,” Graham said. 

 

 She said again on Thursday, the mayor did not pitch up at City Hall. 

 

 “This did not stop her from being on a local radio station that same morning. 

 Our mayor was also well enough this weekend, to campaign alongside President Cyril Ramaphosa,” she said. 

 

 Graham said with the rumours swirling about Gumede’s role in the murder of Councillor Sbu Maphumulo, it was clear that the mayor was avoiding City Hall. 

 “She must come clear about what is going on. She is paid to work and not shirk her responsibilities for political reasons. Council and Exco meetings should be her first priority,” Graham said. 

 

 Mayoral spokesperson, Mthunzi Gumede, rubbished the claims. 

 

 “The mayor  continues to perform all her duties, including any ceremonial functions, and exercises the powers delegated to her by the municipal council. When our hardworking and committed mayor, Zandile Gumede, is away on council business, our deputy mayor attends to all duties as prescribed in the legislation,” he said.
