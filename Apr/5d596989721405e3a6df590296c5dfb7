Durban - THE University of KwaZulu-Natal conferred a honorary social sciences doctorate on Protas Madlala, an anti-apartheid activist who fought for vulnerable people who faced forced removals.
Madlala facilitated the establishment of 'Save St. Wendolines' in the 1980s, which was granted permanent 'settlement' status after he spearheaded a petition to the then apartheid Minister of Constitutional Development. 
More recently, as chief executive officer of the eThekwini Small Enterprise Development Agency, he took a personal loan on his own accord, to enable the payment of salaries for workers at the organisation.
Madlala, who is also known as a political analyst, while speaking at the graduation ceremony on Wednesday, called on graduates to take a stand and remedy the current situation in the country and become agents of change.
“No government will develop you. You have to change your attitude on your own. As South Africans, remember that society owes you nothing,” he said. 
He advised graduates to use their qualifications to uplift their families and themselves.  
“Use it to uplift your families,” said Madlala. “The country is crying for servant leadership that addresses the needs of the poor. Don’t allow yourself to be captured for a vote by promises of a first world system. It won’t work if the people continue to be poor,” he said.
