DURBAN - The Kwazulu-Natal Health Department said the number of diarrhoea cases in Vryheid had decreased.
Yesterday KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo visited Vryheid Hospital where some of the patients were being treated. He said a series of interventions at the hospital had led to drastic improvements.

“The intervention at this hospital is excellent. Once admitted, the patients are taken care of and discharged within three days, in a stable state,” said Dhlomo.
He said from March 22 there had been 535 admissions at Vryheid Hospital, referred mainly from Bhekuzulu Clinic and Mason Clinic.
“The lab results of both stools of the patients and the water samples are showing no sign of Vibrio cholera, typhoid or any other known pathogens that cause severe diarrhoea,” said Dhlomo.

The MEC said the community had been advised to boil water “even if it comes from the tap” until further notice.
“We are also aware that the municipality has increased the chlorine content at the reservoirs,” he said.
He said the department’s laboratory would continue to look for other pathogens that might be causing the diarrhoea.

“But since these interventions that we’ve put in place, we have been noticing a decreasing number of admissions of patients with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting,” he said.
