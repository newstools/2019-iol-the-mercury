DURBAN - MEC for Human Settlements in KwaZulu-Natal, Ravi Pillay, has heaped praise on emergency workers and residents who joined hands to rescue those stranded as a result of the floods in Durban. 
 

 Pillay visited the site of a structural collapse in Westcliff, near Chatsworth, that claimed the lives of eight people. 

 

 "The disaster management teams which include the Search and Rescue units, Metro Police and fire units, have been stretched to their limits. We want to pay tribute to them for their efforts. Many of the members are still working from yesterday afternoon and are continuing to work now. I also want to pay tribute to the local community in Westcliff who mobilised trucks and excavators to remove the bodies that were trapped," he said. 

 

 According to Rescue Care's Garrith Jamieson, eight people were killed in the mudslide while two more people have been rushed to hospital. 

 

 "They are currently still in hospital. The recovery took hours to today to complete. Cranes were utilised to remove the excess rubble," he said. 

 

 According to reports, teams responded to 28 callouts ranging from structural collapses, drownings, mudslides and entrapments in and around Durban. 

 Members have worked through more than 24 hours and extra units were brought in to assist. It is believed that a
  total of 21 bodies were recovered and 15 people were rescued from life threatening situations with six people still missing and presumed dead at several scenes.
