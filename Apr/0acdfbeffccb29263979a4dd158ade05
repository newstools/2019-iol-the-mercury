DURBAN - A week before the elections, the Department of Home Affairs has announced an extension of its working hours - on three days next week - to provide voters with services.
Department spokesperson David Hlabane said the extension would help eligible voters to collect identity documents they had applied for or to apply for IDs or temporary identity certificates.

He said from May 6 to 8, the department would align its business hours with those of the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC).
“Accordingly, on May 6 and 7, offices will extend their operational hours from 4pm to 7pm to cater for people seeking access to services on these two special voting days,” Hlabane said.
Hlabane said Home Affairs front offices would also provide public services on election day, May 8, from 7am until 9pm, when IEC voting stations close.

He warned that if the public were not in possession of a smart ID card, green ID book or temporary identity certificate supplied by Home Affairs, they could not vote.
“It is worrying that by end of March 2019, the department had recorded a total of 355257 uncollected smart ID cards and 3620 uncollected green ID books,” said Hlabane. 
He said the total of all uncollected identity documents stood at 358877.
