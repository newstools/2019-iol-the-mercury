 The seven were nabbed for drug possession. 
 The group of men and women have taken refuge alongside the M4 after they were chased from the area under the M4 highway last month. 

 
  
 

 They are believed to have made their way up into the Glenwood and Morningside areas in recent weeks. 

 

 While residents believe the group is simply being displaced to regroup and gather in another area, the municipality has said they have a number of programmes planned to address the issue. 

 

 According to spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, t
 he municipality is tasked with a responsibility to deliver services to all in a sustainable 
  
 manner. 

 

 According to Mayisela, th
 e municipality recently hosted the stakeholder sessions on homelessness with an aim to 
 mobilise all stakeholders to work together through an all-of-society approach to address 
  
 homelessness in line with the vision of the Municipality of being a caring and liveable city by 
  
 2030.
