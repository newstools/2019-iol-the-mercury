Durban - Freedom fighter and medical doctor, Prof Yosuf Veriava, was bestowed the Order of Luthuli in silver for his contribution to the medical profession in South Africa.
In a ceremony on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa honoured inspiring South Africans for their contribution to the country.

Veriava, 76, of Mayfair in Joburg, said he was delighted to receive such a prestigious award recognising his lifetime’s work.
“It is especially significant as it coincides with the 25th anniversary of our democracy and is linked to a highly respected man,” he said.
The award to Veriava was for his “brilliant contribution to the medical profession in South Africa”. 

“He has consistently personified medical ethics and progressiveness. 
“He courageously pushed back the barriers of the unjust and progressive laws of apartheid.”
Veriava was one of the doctors who challenged the medical establishment and the apartheid government over the unethical conduct of two doctors involved in struggle icon Steve Biko’s case. 

He defended the issue of organ trafficking in South Africa at an international conference and was involved in the investigation into the illegal organ trafficking from a clinical perspective.
Veriava headed up the Department of Internal Medicine at Wits University and sits on the Ministerial Technical Task Team for the medical training of South African students in Cuba. 
Veriava assists the Gauteng Department of Health as a co-convener of the Independent Panel on Patient Safety and Medico-legal Litigation.
