DURBAN - KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Nomusa Dube-Ncube officially opened the R16million Amahlubi Community Service Centre (CSC) in the Inkosi Langalibalele (Estcourt) Local Municipality this week.
Dube said the launch of the centre meant residents did not need to travel long distances to access government services. 

Government services that will be available at the centre include services offered by Home Affairs, Post Office, the Social Development Department, ward councillors and the local Inkosi. 
“We are committed to changing the lives of residents of the uThukela District who reside in rural areas. Youth within the surrounding communities are now attending computer lessons at the digital learning centre, which is housed within the CSC. This helps them to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the fourth industrial revolution,” said Dube-Ncube.
Sabelo Buthelezi, 26, a resident in the Bhekuzulu community, said the opening of the centre was a positive development for the youth. He said he would now be able to do a course on programming at the centre.

In his address during the opening ceremony, Inkosi MJ Radebe thanked Dube-Ncube for the level of commitment shown by the provincial government in bringing tangible service delivery to the area. 
KZN Cogta has in the past five years built three community service centres in the uThukela District Municipality, in Okhalamba, Bergville, eKuvukeni and now Amahlubi CSCs.
