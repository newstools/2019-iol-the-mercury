DURBAN - South Africa’s power supply is looking rosier, but Eskom warned that the risk of load shedding remained for the next year.
This was the essence of an update yesterday by the country’s troubled power utility. 

It reported progress in maintenance, particularly over Easter. The utility noted that load shedding had not been implemented in 36 days. 
Eskom chief operating officer Jan Oberholzer said: “As we continue to perform essential plant maintenance, while carefully balancing the country’s energy requirements with the available capacity, the risk that we may implement load shedding over the next six to 12 months remains. However, this will only be done as a last resort.”
He said Eskom teams executed daily planned maintenance totalling more than 7000MW at the Easter weekend. 

Eskom had seen improvement in plant performance and the recovery of diesel tank levels at the open-cycle gas turbines, and better management of dam levels at pumped-storage schemes. Oberholzer said there was also a recovery of supply from one of the two Cahora Bassa power lines.
Work on the new Kusile and Medupi power stations continued, with Kusile Unit 3 synchronised to the national grid for the first time on April 14.
