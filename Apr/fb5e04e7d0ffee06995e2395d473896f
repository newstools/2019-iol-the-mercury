DURBAN- Umgeni Water has rubbished claims that their employees have gone on strike. 
 

 The board was responding to messages circulated on social media, claiming that disgruntled employees have downed tools over salary increases. 
 
  
 
 
  Taking to their social media platforms, Umgeni Water said the messages doing the rounds, are "grossly incorrect".
 
 
  
 
 
  "The factual situation is that some staff of eThekwini Water and Sanitation are involved in a dispute with their management that has resulted in a strike. Umgeni water and eThekwini Metro/eThekwini Water and Sanitation are separate entitites. Umgeni Water is a water board and, as is known, eThekwini Metro is a municipality. Workers of municipalities generally belong to the South African Municipal Workers' union. Unionised staff of Umgeni Water belong to the National Health and Allied Workers Union," Umgeni said. 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  On Monday morning, a flurry of messages about protests across the city were posted on a number of social media sites and groups.  
  The protests have been condemned by KwaZulu-Natal premier, Willies Mchunu.
