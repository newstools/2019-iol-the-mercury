DURBAN - Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan's commitment to keeping the lights on this winter, has been welcomed by Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry President, Musa Makhunga. 
Makhunga was commenting following a press briefing in which Gordhan announced plans for a sustainable power supply for the remainder of the year.

"This is positive news for our members and the business community at large and we are encouraged by the fact that government has reacted with a positive plan and approach to addressing to South Africa’s energy crisis,"Makhunga said.
He said the announcement at least provides  businesses with some assurance with regards to energy supply. 
"The government and Eskom need to ensure that this plan is properly actioned with contingencies and actionable escalation processes that will help prevent any mishaps or missteps that can result in further financial losses for business," he said. 

Makhunga strongly urged the business community to remain prepared and to ensure that there are contingency plans in place to maintain productivity levels especially for plants which run 24-hour production cycles and construction sites that run high powered equipment.
"The Durban Chamber will continue to keep its membership and stakeholders updated regarding load shedding. Businesses are encouraged to keep a close watch on published load shedding schedules and announcements via the various media channels," he said.
