Durban - Police in KwaZulu-Natal have appealed for public assistance in the case of a Durban North businessman who was murdered at his office last Friday afternoon.
Businessman Alfred Dlamini, who ran a plastic recycling business with his wife, was shot dead in his office when armed men entered his premises, asked for him and shot him dead. The shooting of the 49-year-old took place on Friday just after 5pm at his Everest Road business property, which also serves as his residence.
The three suspects reportedly casually left the business premises after the shooting and escape.
Provincial police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said police were still investigating the matter and were yet to make arrests.
“The matter is still under investigation. We are appealing to anyone who might have information about the suspects involved to contact their nearest police station or Crime Stop number on 08600 10111,” said Gwala on Wednesday.
Gwala’s mysterious death has been reportedly described as a hit as no possessions were taken during the shooting.
At the time, Crisis Medical’s Kyle van Reenen said it appeared none of Dlamini's possessions had been stolen.
“We found the victim lying there. We followed all the necessary procedures and he was found unresponsive. He was still in possession of all his belongings and it did not appear that the business was burgled,” said van Reenen.
