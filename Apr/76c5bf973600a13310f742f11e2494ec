DURBAN - South African National Parks (SANParks) said yesterday that two of their field rangers were attacked by an elephant in the Kruger National Park.
SANParks said the incident happened on Saturday.

Acting general manager of communications at the Kruger National Park, Nhlanhla Themba, said: “Alfred Maluleke and Bethuel Khoza, stationed in Pafuri in the north of the park, had an encounter with an elephant while on patrol.”
Themba said they escaped with minor injuries due to their skills and knowledge of wildlife behaviour.
“The rangers were rushed to a nearby hospital for observation and were later discharged.”

Kruger National Park managing executive, Glenn Phillips, has extended his well wishes to the two rangers: “These are some of the many dangers our rangers face daily. It is not only poachers who pose a threat to our men and women in green.”
