DURBAN - Shoprite is still accepting bursary applications for the 2019 academic year. 
 

 Accounting (first and second year), logistics, IT and data sciences as well as retail business management students have a chance at being awarded a bursary of up to R70000 by completing an online application.
Last year, 286 students benefited from the Shoprite bursary programme.

Each bursary comes with a work-back agreement, which would see the successful applicant assured of a job once they have graduated.

Trainee accountant Mpilo Sicwebu, 23, of Durban, was a Shoprite bursary holder for the duration of his studies at Wits University. Now an accounting article clerk at Shoprite’s home office, he said no two work days were ever the same: “I expected an every-man-for-himself environment, but was surprised to find that everyone here is so accessible and willing to help me grow and develop.”

Shoprite Group became the first retailer in South Africa, 21 years ago, to receive accreditation as a training office from the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants. Sicwebu is one of 30 candidates currently doing their articles at Shoprite.

It is not only accounting students that benefit from a structured programme once they join the group. A graduate programme is rolled out to all bursary holders it employs.
