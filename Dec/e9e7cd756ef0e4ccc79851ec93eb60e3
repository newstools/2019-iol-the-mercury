Durban - The MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka confirmed that disaster management teams have been placed on high alert following a weather warning issued by the South African Weather Services on Tuesday afternoon. 
Hlomuka said heavy rain and the possibility of severe thunderstorms in uThukela, uMgungundlovu and the Harry Gwala districts.

"The warning indicates the high possibility of heavy rains which can lead to localised flooding and reduced visibility. "We have placed our teams on high alert as inclement weather conditions continue to pose a serious risk to residents in our province. Our teams are monitoring areas that are prone to flooding and will be able to respond should any situations arise," said Hlomuka.



    The weather warning also indicates that there is a risk of gale-force winds along the uMkhanyakude district coast which could potentially uproot trees. 


 



"We are appealing to residents, especially along the coast, to put their safety first and ensure that they seek shelter in a sturdy building during these strong winds," said Hlomuka. 



    High seas are expected along the coast of the province with heavy swells above four metres. Hlomuka has called upon parents and those who might be going to the beach to take the necessary precautions.
