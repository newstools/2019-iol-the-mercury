Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Education Department has condemned the torching of a Pinetown high school yesterday allegedly by pupils who had been aggrieved by their “poor” end-of-year results.
The office of the school principal, the school kitchen and the staffroom at the Zwelinjani Secondary School in Zwelibombu, Pinetown, were destroyed during the fire that broke out after pupils received their report cards.

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of arson was opened at KwaNdengezi police station. 
“Today at 11am, a group of school pupils allegedly broke the school windows with stones and burnt a room where new stationery was kept,” Mbele said.
KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Education, Kwazi Mshengu, said: “Our district officials have assured us that no one was injured in the fire, but the property was destroyed.

“There are claims that the fire started after chaos erupted when the school reports were issued to pupils. The pupils felt that the results they had obtained were not what they deserved. They allegedly accused the teachers of giving them bad marks,” Mshengu said.
He appealed to the pupils not to resort to violence when addressing their concerns.
“We wish to emphasise that we will not reward anarchy by building another school when in fact it was destroyed deliberately,” said Mshengu. 

The department said it would need to determine which documents had been burned, and to see if those that had been burned had been backed up with soft copies.
