 Last month, 
 a fire broke out at another factory in Jacobs Road.  At the time, Jamieson said a blaze broke out at the chemical factory just after 3pm. No injuries were reported. 

 

 In August, a fire broke out at the Safripol fibre plant in Jacobs. Hundreds of residents complained of breathing problems.
