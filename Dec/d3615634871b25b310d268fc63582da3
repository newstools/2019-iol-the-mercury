Cape Town - South Africans have been struggling to keep up with all the constant changes in load shedding stages, with the result leaving some even having their power cut twice in one day.
On Monday, barely hours after announcing the continuation of Stage 2 load shedding, Eskom has confirmed that this will move to Stage 4 from 10am until 11pm.

The entity also said the probability of load shedding remained high for the week as a result of a shortage of capacity.
Earlier this year the Western Cape MEC for Finance and Economic Opportunities, David Maynier, revealed that load shedding cost the Western Cape economy R150 million per day.
Maynier said the Western Cape government had taken a number of actions to mitigate the impact of load shedding on the provincial economy and build energy resilience. Despite this, the cost remained high, particularly for manufacturing.

And this just for the Western Cape alone.
Besides the toll on the economy, load shedding has also had a massive effect on the lives of SA residents.
From the serious to the lighthearted, these are some of the sentiments and feelings shared by many South Africans as they endure the struggle of load shedding:

There were some who pointed out that one thing you could always rely on, when it came to Eskom, was it's punctuality and efficiency for implementing load shedding on the scheduled time.


 




I just want to take a moment to applaud the punctuality of loadshedding. When they say 8am, it’s 8am. Metrorail can learn from Eskom.

The one thing that government gets right without fail, loadshedding time. If it's 14:00 you best believe it it's going to be right on the dot or to be impressive, thirty minutes before. #ShitKom

 Others have found their days becoming harder to start as Eskom has been getting in the way of their coffee-drinking.


 




Loadshedding before you've had the chance to make a cup of coffee. F&&$ you Eskom! 😡😡😡

When people hear loadshedding would happen in the next hour, there was a stampede to the coffee shops for that strong cup to see them through 2 and a half hours of no technology and no idea what to do! #loadshedding #coffeelovers

Data prices are already causing financial difficulty for cash-strapped South Africans, but due to load shedding, residents have not only had to use more of their data, but also put up with diminishing signal quality as some service providers are being impacted by the power cuts.


 



Eskom needs to pay for all the data i use during loadshedding 😔

So signal must also go when there’s loadshedding?😓

We pay a premium for data and services yet we get a sub standard customer experience. That's what happens when most of the market is held by 1 player. They can just focus on profits and not really give AF about their customers. Loadshedding has been going on forever.@vodacom pic.twitter.com/0wrxkCrwAe

Not even the clubs are safe from feeling the cost of load shedding:


 



What’s happening in clubs vele? #Loadshedding

Right after they closed the club due to loadshedding, the lights decided to finally come back on and now everyone is cancelling their Uber’s and waking back into the club. What a time. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

 Complaints aside, there has been a number of social media users who have raised the issue of how power cuts have been affecting their safety and is likely impacting on crime.

Just like that, my already dodgy, crime-ridden area has been plunged into darkness as our Power Utility are shutting off sections of the grid for 2 hours at a time, due to decades of neglect, graft and malfeasance.
