Pretoria - Convicted Nigerian terrorist leader Henry Okah lost yet another court bid to be freed, but he vowed to not give up and to once again turn directly to the Constitutional Court.Gauteng High Court, Pretoria judge Moses Mavundla advised Okah on Friday to carefully consider his next step, as the apex court only allowed direct access to it in exceptional circumstances.The judge told Okah that if he wanted to launch a leave to appeal application against the judgment in the high court, he was welcome to do so in January.But Okah, who was heavily guarded by armed correctional services officers, said he will “100%” turn to the Constitutional Court.In asking the court earlier this month to declare his conviction on terrorist related charges unlawful and to ultimately set him free, he told the judge: “I am not a terrorist. I am a prisoner of war.”Okah, who conducted his own case, not only lost his application, but he was slapped with the hefty legal bill, which included three advocates - one of which is a senior advocate - on Government’s side.He is serving a 24 year prison term after he was convicted in 2013 on several terrorist related charges. It followed the bombings in the Nigerian cities of Warri and Abudja in March and October 2010.

  Convicted Nigerian terrorist leader Henry Okah lost yet another court bid to be freed, but he vowed to not give up and to once again turn directly to the Constitutional Court. Video: Zelda Venter.
 

 Twelve people were killed during the bombing in Abuja and 36 were 
 injured, while one person was killed and 11 serious injured in Warri.
 
 
 As he was arrested in South Africa later and planned one of the 
 bombings here, he was tried in a South African court.
 
 
 His application for the court to declare that he was a participant in 
 a non-international armed conflict and thus protected by the Geneva 
 Convention, was refused by Judge Mavundla.
 
 
 Okah earlier argued that he is entitled to appear before a tribunal 
 as contemplated by the Convention and that he should have never been 
 tried by a criminal court in this country.
 
 
 He argued that his rights to a fair trial were violated as he was 
 prosecuted under the wrong statute. 
 
  
 
 
  “If you argue that anyone who 
  fights against his government is a terrorist, everyone who fought for 
  liberation in South Africa would then be a terrorist,” he said.
  
  
  He said he was merely embroiled in an armed conflict against the 
  Nigerian government and said the people who died and were injured 
  during the two bombings, were mainly members of the Nigerian security 
  forces.
  
  
  Okah is the leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger 
  Delta (MEND).
  
  
  Following his conviction, Okah turned to the Supreme Court of Appeal 
  in Bloemfontein, which overturned his convictions regarding the Warri 
  bombings. His sentence was reduced to 20 years imprisonment, but 
  following an appeal to the Constitutional Court by the prosecution, 
  that court reinstated the convictions and 24 year sentence. 
  
   
  
  
   It also 
   dismissed Okah’s cross appeal that he should have been dealt with 
   under the Rome Statute.
   
   
   Two more appeals by Okah to the high court and the SCA on technical 
   points also failed.
   
   
   Judge Mavundla said Okah had exhausted his appeal rights as 
   his applications were dismissed by various courts. 
  
  
   
  
  
   “An accused and 
   sentenced person cannot be allowed to seek to have a second bite of 
   the cherry, by seeking to have his conviction and sentence set aside
   
   after he had already exhausted his appeal rights…”
   
   
   Okah is being kept at Pretoria’s C-Max Prison as he is regarded 
   as a high risk prisoner. He was brought here earlier from the maximum 
   security prison in Kokstad in light of this application.
