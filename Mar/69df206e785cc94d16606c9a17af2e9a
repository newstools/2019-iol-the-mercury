DURBAN - Police in the Free State had to rush an alleged drug dealer to hospital after he swallowed mandrax tablets while trying to get rid of them, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, also known as the Hawks, said yesterday.
Spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said investigators were on Friday probing a drug-dealing case and followed up on information about a drug delivery in Virginia.

A vehicle was spotted and the driver sped away.
“In an attempt to evade arrest, the 55-year-old suspect rammed the police vehicle but he was arrested. During the pursuit he threw away a large amount of suspected mandrax into a stormwater drain,” said Mulaudzi.
“He also swallowed some of the drugs and police were forced to contact the emergency services to take him to hospital.

"Members retrieved a few mandrax tablets from the drain and a white powder inside the vehicle.”
The man appeared in the Welkom Magistrate’s Court yesterday on charges of dealing in drugs and reckless driving.
In another separate case, the same investigators arrested two men aged 25 and 43 for allegedly dealing in drugs.

Mulaudzi said the two were arrested on Friday at two houses in Bronville and Welkom.
“At the first house members managed to seize mandrax tablets and dagga worth over R70000.
Methcathinone and dagga worth about R45000 were confiscated at the second house.

"Both suspects were due to appear yesterday," the spokesperson said.
