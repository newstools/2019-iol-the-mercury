DURBAN - A 46-year-old fisherman, who survived a shark attack while trying to free the predator from fishing nets near Port Elizabeth, was rescued and taken to hospital by the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI).
Justin Erasmus, NSRI Port Elizabeth deputy station commander, said the incident occurred on Tuesday.

He said a duty crew was put on alert after reports from a fishing trawler at fishing grounds 30 nautical miles off-shore of Port Elizabeth.
“A Cape Town fisherman on board sustained shark bite lacerations to his left forearm and upper arm during attempts to release an approximately 2.5m shark that had been caught in their fishing nets and had been hauled aboard the fishing trawler.”
Erasmus said the shark was successfully released and the alarm was raised before the trawler returned to Port Elizabeth.

The man was in a stable condition.
