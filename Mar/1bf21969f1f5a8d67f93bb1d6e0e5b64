DURBAN - The South African Giant Pumpkin record has been smashed again at the Livingseeds Giant Pumpkin Competition on Saturday at the Walkerville Agricultural Show in Gauteng.
First place and the new South African record went to Peet Joubert who fielded a pumpkin weighing in at a whopping 613kg.

Joubert’s giant was an outright winner with his closest competitor displaying a pumpkin of 357.5kg.
Livingseeds.co.za sponsored R15000 for first place, with Fastway Couriers sponsoring an additional R15000, an incentive for a South African record-breaking pumpkin. This netted Joubert a cool R30000 and the national pumpkin growers record.
He is new to pumpkin growing, and says that this was one of the most stressful things he had accomplished.

“These pumpkins grow at such a rapid rate that one can see them gaining between 25 and 30kgs in a single day.
“With an average growing period of between 70 and 80 days, an immense amount of attention is required to ensure that nothing goes wrong with such a prized pumpkin,” Joubert said. He said he spent at least two hours a day tending to his prize-winning pumpkin, with the December period seeing in excess of five hours a day of pure love and attention being poured into his behemoth.
Loading such a pumpkin from your back garden is a mission that cannot be underestimated; his trailer used to carry the pumpkin became bogged down in the soft soil with the weight of the pumpkin.
