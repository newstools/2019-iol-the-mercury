DURBAN - The Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union (Hospersa) in KwaZulu-Natal is calling for improved working conditions at Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife.
The union said that in an attempt to address the challenges and concerns workers face at the organisation, its members would be marching in Pietermaritzburg today.

Hospersa KZN provincial secretary Popson Kunene said members would be marching to Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife offices to hand over a memorandum of demands.
Kunene said there were six key issues that would be raised in the memorandum: “Non-sitting of salary negotiations for the past two years; the closure of working stations by the Department of Labour; casualisation of employees; movement of staff; poor management and maladministration; and high levels of staff shortages,” he said.
He added that Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife had come under heavy criticism in recent years over its financial woes. “The criticism has been attributed to non-filling of key vacancies, poor management and corruption, as well as poor leadership by its board.

“Hospersa’s march will look to put pressure on Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife to address these challenges and improve the working conditions of its members,” said Kunene.
Members were due to march from midday from Queen Elizabeth Park Nature Reserve in Town Bush Valley to the Ezemvelo office foyer at the main gate, where the memorandum was to be handed over.
Ezemvelo did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.
