DURBAN - South Africans wanting to travel or work abroad are urged to familiarise themselves with the legislation and agreements between the two countries prior to booking their flights.
This is according to eThekwini Municipality Head of International and Governance Relations, Eric Apelgren. 

He was speaking following an uMlazi family’s almost month-long struggle to have the remains of their daughter, who died in the Bahamas, brought back to South Africa for traditional burial.
Apelgren said the Department of International Relations and Co-operation (Dirco) has a user-friendly portal that clearly outlines the processes followed if a South African citizen is arrested, falls ill, loses a passport or dies in another country. 
He said that in the case of Nobuhle Bhengu, who died while working aboard an MSC ship docked in the Bahamas, her family was able to see her body before she was cremated. 

According to a coroner’s report, 29-year-old Bhengu died from tuberculosis in February. 
Due to international health standards, subscribed to by both the South African and Bahamian governments, Bhengu’s body could not be flown home. 
Apelgren said MSC management worked with local government structures and paid for Bhengu’s family to fly to the Bahamas to view her body before the cremation.
