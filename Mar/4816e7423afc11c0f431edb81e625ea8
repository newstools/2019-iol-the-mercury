Durban - Community leaders from Siyanda want more safety measures to be implemented at the Dumisani Mkhaye intersection with Inanda Road where four schoolgirls were mowed down by a minibus taxi on Monday.

 

 Three of the girls died at the scene and a fourth was rushed to hospital in critical condition.

 

 In the wake of the tragedy, the community barricaded the intersection with burning tyres demanding that the government heed their calls for better safety at the intersection.

 

 The leaders told Public Order Policing they will not move or clear the road of burning tyres until officials put interim measures.

 

 The community of Siyanda which overlooks Dumisani Highway are also angry with neighbouring taxi associations for driving recklessly.

 "Now that the collision has taken place what next. The police need to be here monitoring the intersection for those driving fast and passing through red robots. Small children going to neighbouring schools in Newlands are in danger," a leader said. 

 

 Police are on the scene in numbers trying to negotiate with the protestors to reopen the road to Pinetown.
