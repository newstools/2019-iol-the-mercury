DURBAN - Student protests erupted at three University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) campuses yesterday.
Speaking to The Mercury at the Howard College campus yesterday, students said they were tired of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) “taking their time” to resolve their issues. Topping their list of demands were proper housing and funding.

Student Sandile Masuku said they heard singing outside classes and were told to abandon lectures.
“They said we burn the residences and furniture so we will have to wait as they are still getting new ones. It has been over a month and postgraduate applications for honours and masters degrees and doctorates have not been responded to,” said Masuku.
Students yesterday stoned a university vehicle. When The Mercury arrived at midday, students were on the upper levels of Howard campus hurling rocks at the police and security.

Security guards, armed with paintball guns, fired at protesting students while police fired tear gas into the air.
An examination hosted by the KZN Law Society had to be postponed on both the Durban and Pietermaritzburg campuses after students disrupted the examination halls. Other tests and examinations were also postponed.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said two students were arrested for public violence.

Classes were also disrupted at the Edgewood and Westville campuses.
UZKN said last night that the academic programmes had been suspended until further notice at
Edgewood and Westville campuses. It said the suspension would allow management space to engage with student leadership.
