Durban - From custom-made belts, to refrigerator services and weave washing, Durban students are making money from small businesses on campus.
After the day’s studies and tests, some students burn the midnight oil by making products that they sell to fellow students.

And the University of KwaZulu- Natal recently established The Student Entrepreneurs and Innovators Society to support the growing culture of entrepreneurship.
Thoro Organic Products is one such business, brought to students by owner Gundo Maano.
“I have always had a passion for natural beauty in terms of hair and skin, but I couldn’t find affordable organic products without long and scary chemical names as ingredients.

“This sparked a passion to fill the large gap between those who also want organic products for reasonable prices and the expensive international market,” she said.
Maano has set days for orders to be dispatched, allowing for time to focus on her studies.
The Student Entrepreneurship Society website went live last month.

Acting public relations manager Thandiwe Jumo of the College of Law and Management Studies said the society would promote intercollegiate collaboration for students, and host seminars and workshops for emerging entrepreneur students.
