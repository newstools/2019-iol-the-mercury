DURBAN - Opposition parties at eThekwini Municipality have raised concerns about the city’s continued cash injection of more than R3.8 million to fund the African Renaissance Festival.
The conference will take place at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in May.

The African Renaissance Festival is held as part of the Africa Day celebrations and comprises a conference, a banquet, VIP cocktail event and a concert.
In a report brought to the city’s exco by the Economic Development and Planning Committee yesterday, it was recommended that R3.85m be transferred to the Ukuvuselelwa KwamaAfrica Awareness which trades as the African Renaissance. This amount would cover the venue hire costs, promotional campaigns, hosting of the KZN Ebandla Investment Conference and the international bursary programme
DA councillor Nicole Graham and the IFP’s Mdu Nkosi asked why the event organisers could not accrue more sponsorship privately rather than the city forking out this large sum for funding.

Chairperson of the committee, Sipho Kaunda, said the event also served to attract direct foreign investment to the city and needed to be well organised and marketed.
