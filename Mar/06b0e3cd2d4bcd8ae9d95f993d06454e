JOHANNESBURG - A Durban man has been arrested for murder after he killed an assailant who allegedly tried to rape his pregnant girlfriend.
It is alleged that the assailant entered a house in Magwaveni, oThongathi armed with a panga.

Reaction Unit SA spokesperson Prem Balram said that when they arrived at the scene they found a wounded man lying outside the house.
Balram said the man was bleeding profusely from his head and arms.
“It is alleged that the suspect had entered the man’s home and tried to rape a woman, who is five-months pregnant. The man grabbed the panga and hit him with it repeatedly,” Balram said.

He said an ambulance was dispatched, but the man was declared dead at the scene.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that the home owner was arrested and charged for murder.
He appeared in court yesterday.

Zwane said charges of attempted rape and possession of a dangerous weapon would also be investigated.
The home owner’s arrest caused outrage on social media, with many arguing that he was merely protecting his girlfriend and unborn child.
Social activist Yusuf Abramjee warned residents that while they had a right to defend themselves and their family, they must act within the confines of the law.

Abramjee said the murder charge opened against the boyfriend was routine practise when a person was killed.
