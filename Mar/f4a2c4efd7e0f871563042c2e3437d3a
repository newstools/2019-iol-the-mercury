DURBAN - It’s election time this year - to mind come Israel, South Africa and India. While South Africa looks to retain a somewhat wafer-thin ANC majority and India tries to shrug off a Congress comeback, Israel is bubbling with all kinds of political complexities, from a prime minister under a moral radar for corruption to parties being labelled racist and terrorist.
Israel’s Election Board has approved far-right candidates in the April 9 elections.

Benjamin Netanyahu, who is fighting for political survival, is seeking a coalition with Jewish Power, a party accused of racism. Netanyahu has three corruption charges against him by Israel’s attorney-general.
The Arab party, Raam Balaad, headed by Mansour Abbas, has been labelled a terrorist party because of its Palestinian and Lebanese leanings. The party describes itself as a democratic movement opposed to Zionism and Palestinian occupation.
It holds eight seats as part of the 12-member United Arab List, representing members of Israel’s Arab minority.

While the Israelis are laureates in physics, economics, chemistry and literature,.
Their prize-winning in quantum computing, black-hole thermal dynamics and string theory will come down to nothing if they cannot solve the decades-old issue of the occupation and ostracisation of the people of Palestine.
Hopefully a new government will be able to move forward and heal the shameful scars of the past.
