Durban - Three teenage schoolgirls were killed after a minibus taxi ploughed into them as they made their way to school on Wednesday morning.
 

 A fourth school girl sustained critical injuries and was treated by paramedics at the scene. The girls are said to be between the ages of 13 and 14 years old.

 

 According to Rescue Care Paramedics spokesman, Garrith Jamieson, just after 7.15am paramedics were called to the scene of the crash on Dumisani Makhaye Drive near the VN Naik School for the deaf in the Newlands east area.

 

 "On arrival paramedics were faced with absolute tragedy," Jamieson said.

 

 "A single taxi collided with four teenage girls on their way through to school and dragged them for some way. Unfortunately, three of the teenagers had sustained major injuries and there was nothing more paramedics could do for them. They were declared deceased at the scene. Another teenager sustained major injuries and is currently being treated by advanced life support paramedics on the scene and will be transported to a nearby hospital for the further care they need," he said.

 

 The road was closed by police in the wake of the crash and traffic was being diverted.

 

 It was unclear if the driver of the minibus taxi was arrested of or not.

 

 This is a developing story.
