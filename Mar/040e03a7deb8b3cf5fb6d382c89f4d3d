Durban - “Mad Mike” Hoare, who led mercenaries in the Congo in the early 1960s and the coup attempt in the Seychelles 20 years later, turns 100 on Sunday.
“Six of the ‘Wild Geese’ from distant parts of South Africa will join friends and family at a party on Sunday to honour Mike at his home in Durban North,” his son, Chris, told the Independent on Saturday.

His men take this name from a movie about a group of mercenary soldiers hired to rescue a deposed African president.
Richard Burton played the part of their leader, patterned on Mike Hoare, who was hired as the technical adviser.
“Everyone attending will make a short speech in appreciation of Mike,” said Chris, a journalist, who recently launched Mad Mike Hoare: The Legend, his own book about his father.

Asked, via Chris, what it was like to reach 100, Mike said: “It’s not a picnic of course. One doesn’t remember so well any more.
“But I am fortunate to be surrounded by people who care and that takes the sting of old age away.” DUNCAN GUY
