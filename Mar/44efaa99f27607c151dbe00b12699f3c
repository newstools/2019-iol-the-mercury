Durban - Police have arrested the driver allegedly involved in a fatal crash in Durban on Wednesday morning that claimed the lives of three teenagers. 
KZN police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said the driver went to a local police station to report the crash. 

"Charges of culpable homicide were opened at KwaMashu police station for investigation," Zwane said. 
Rescue Care spokesperson, Garrith Jamieson, said four girl pupils were on their way to school when they were hit by the minibus taxi. 
"Three of the four had sustained major injuries and unfortunately there was nothing more Paramedics could do for them and they were declared deceased on the scene.
