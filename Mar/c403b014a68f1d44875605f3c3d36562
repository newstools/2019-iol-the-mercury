DURBAN - Four Paws has launched an international petition for the rescue of all animals at Gaza’s Rafah Zoo, which has already been signed by more than 120000 people worldwide.
Four Paws is calling for the final closure of the notorious zoo, which has been making headlines since the beginning of the year.

In mid-January, four lion cubs froze to death. Only a few weeks later, pictures of a mutilated lioness appeared.
Four Paws is encouraging South Africans to add their voices to the petition and help the organisation advocate a better life for these animals.

Four Paws South Africa director Fiona Miles said: “It is our collective responsibility to ensure this cruelty is curbed. When people unite for animals, we become the voices for those who cannot speak and this gives us hope for animals like the ones suffering in Gaza”.
