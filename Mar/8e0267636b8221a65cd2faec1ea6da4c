DURBAN - Co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube is cracking down on dysfunctional municipalities as this year’s municipal audit outcomes show many are being poorly managed.
Yesterday she announced that the provincial government was taking over the running of the Richmond and Mtubatuba municipalities. 

The decision came a day after she met mayors and municipal managers from the province’s 54 municipalities at the KwaZulu-Natal Municipal Audit Indaba in Durban.
During the meeting, Dube-Ncube warned mayors and municipal managers to fulfil their duties or risk having wasted state funds recovered from them in terms of the Public Audit Amendment Act. It states that officials who do not apply due diligence when handling state funds can be forced to pay back wasted money. 
She said 33 municipalities had unqualified audits, 13 had qualified opinions, one had a disclaimer and seven had adverse findings.

Regarding the Richmond and Mtubatuba municipalities, she said Mtubatuba had failed to meet repeatedly because of a lack of a quorum. “Mtubatuba’s reckless spending now also indicates that the municipality will soon not have sufficient money to fund its operations.”
In Richmond, she said, there had been allegations of maladministration, fraud and corruption. Labour protests, work stoppages and general safety concerns had prevented the auditor-general from completing the audit for the 2017/2018 financial year.
