CAPE TOWN - UCT said yesterday it had moved up two places to reclaim its top 10 position in the 2019 QS World University rankings by subject, placing it among the top 100 universities in nine disciplines.
A total of 1222 institutions were assessed, ranking them across 48 disciplines in five broad subject areas.

The university moved up two places from last year to ninth position for development studies. It is the only university in the global south to feature among the top 10 in this discipline.
Eight other subjects at UCT were also ranked among the top 100, including anatomy and physiology, anthropology, archaeology, architecture/built environment, education, geography, social policy and administration and sports-related subjects.
“We at UCT pride ourselves on the impact of our research in combating the numerous issues faced by our continent - and more broadly, the global south,” vice-chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng said.

“Our position among the top 10 for development studies, in particular, is evidence of the value of our research, and teaching and learning in this area.”
