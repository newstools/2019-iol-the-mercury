DURBAN - Disgruntled police officers at various stations in KwaZulu-Natal have already embarked on a go-slow to demonstrate their unhappiness with “unfair promotions”.
Telephones at several stations in Durban went unanswered yesterday. 

One police officer told The Mercury that some officers were refusing to respond to call-outs.
“Things are really bad at station level. I am spending time listening to the radio. In Sydenham, members are refusing to respond to call-outs, saying the Tactical Response Team (TRT) should respond instead.”
In Folweni, members have refused to work the night shift, challenging SAPS management to call in the TRT to work the shift. 

Another police officer said the promotions debacle had caused so much bitterness within the SAPS ranks that it was threatening to derail the fight against crime.
“There are members who finished college in 2017 who have now received promotions, while we are being overlooked at station level. It’s not fair,” he said.
