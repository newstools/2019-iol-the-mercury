DURBAN - A private investigator looking into the poisoning incident in eMdloti, north of Durban, that left 13 monkeys dead, has identified suspects who might have been behind the incident.
Sean Peirce told The Mercury he had identified suspects and witnesses. “Samples have been taken to a laboratory for testing and we are awaiting the outcome.

“Once that has been received, it will be handed over to the SPCA. A case can be opened under the Animal Cruelty Act,” he said.
Peirce declined to say how many people had been questioned, saying he wanted to follow correct protocol.
At the weekend, a troop of monkeys from the area were given a loaf of bread laced with Aldicarb (trade name Temik), an insecticide more harmful than arsenic.

Nine more monkeys are recovering at veterinary clinics in the area.
Carol Booth of the Monkey Helpline said it would take a while for the monkeys to be fully well and released. She said they had suffered neurological damage.
SPCA Durban and Coast marketing manager Tanya Fleischer said they were saddened by the monkey-poisoning saga.

“We are working with private investigators and organisations to gather all necessary information and follow up on leads. Once we have more information, we will update the public,” Fleischer said.
