DURBAN - The authorities have urged witnesses who have information about an incident in which security guards fired their weapons at a funeral in Dundee to come forward.
This comes after a video of the incident, believed to have taken place earlier this month, went viral on social media.

In the video, two of the men are seen firing a handgun and an automatic rifle multiple times in the air, while members of the public look on.
“We cannot tolerate incidents which put the lives of citizens in danger,” said Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa.
Mntungwa said MEC Mxolisi Kaunda strongly condemned the incident.

“The MEC has asked police to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure all those who were implicated in this incident face the full might of the law,” said Mntungwa.
Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) spokesperson Velisile Chauke said the security body would also investigate the incident.
National Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said the law states that you cannot just fire randomly in a built-up area or in a crowd of people.

“It's a criminal offence. It's extremely dangerous, people can get killed even though they fire in the air,” said Naidoo.
