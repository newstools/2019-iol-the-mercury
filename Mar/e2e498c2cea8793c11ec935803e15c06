DURBAN - South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) provincial secretary Nomarashiya Caluza has been cleared of allegations of fraud.
Caluza was investigated after allegations surfaced that she did not possess professional teaching qualifications and her academic qualifications were fraudulent.

In January, she was asked to step down from her post as a council member at the South African Council of Educators (Sace).
In a press briefing yesterday, Sadtu said Caluza’s qualifications were legitimate and that she had completed her honours in education and would soon receive postgraduate diploma in industrial relations. She had also registered for a masters degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.
Speaking at the briefing, an emotional Caluza said she was relieved.

The investigation into her qualifications was conducted by both Sace and the Hawks.
“This outcome comes as no surprise to Sadtu. We also conducted our own internal investigation and found that there was no merit in the allegations,” Sadtu deputy provincial secretary Bheki Shandu said.
Sadtu believes the allegations were started by Caluza’s predecessor Mbuyiseni Mathonsi.

“We further believe that these allegations were meant to mislead members and workers within the education sector to join Mathonsi’s new union,” the union said.
Caluza said she would be taking legal action against Mathonsi.
Mathonsi laughed off Caluza and Sadtu’s statements. He questioned why proof of the qualifications had not been provided to the media.
