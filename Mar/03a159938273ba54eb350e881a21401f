Durban - Scores of illegally erected dwellings have been demolished in Cato Crest. On Monday morning, Metro Police along with members of the cityâ€™s Land Invasion Unit descended on Mary Thiphe Road where they demolished a number of shacks built by invaders in the last two weeks.
Towards the end of February, a large group of people arrived in the area and burnt the bushes alongside Mary Thiphe Road. They then built between 20 to 30 shacks on the piece of land.

Last week Friday, the Durban High Court granted eThekwini Municipality an order to remove the structures and take away the building material, which included sticks and large sheets of plastic.
A meeting was held between residents and Deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer and MEC for Human Settlements, Ravi Pillay. Pillay urged residents to set up a committee that would monitor threats of invasion and immediately report it to the necessary authorities.
