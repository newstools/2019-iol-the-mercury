DURBAN - The woman who was captured on video abusing her grandmother appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday.
Nokulunga Makhathini, 31, was arrested at the weekend after a video of the January 1 incident went viral.

Police said yesterday that the matter was adjourned to Monday next week and Makhathini was remanded in custody.
Department of Social Development spokesperson Ncumisa Ndelu said abuse of the elderly was rife.
“In some cases they are robbed of their pension grants.

“What we are seeing is that people are getting sick of it and are exposing it,” said Ndelu.
“Once a case is reported to us, we assist the elderly to open criminal cases and provide psychosocial support and, where necessary, we place them in residential care facilities,” Ndelu said.
Femada Shamam, chief executive of The Association for the Aged (Tafta), said the organisation was concerned by a lack of respect for elders by youth.

Jo-Anne Stevens-O’connor, from Pietermaritzburg and District Council for the Care of the Aged, said the abuse of pensioners for their money had always been a problem.
