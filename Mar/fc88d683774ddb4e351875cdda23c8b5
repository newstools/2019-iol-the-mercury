DURBAN - This month, eThekwini Municipality has begun training 200 unemployed youths through the Artisan Development Programme. 
 

 The programme that will run over three years focuses on plumbing and electrical courses.
This after the municipality accep- ted funding of R33 million from the Energy and Water Sector Education and Training Authority to implement the programme.

Acting deputy city manager of the Corporate and Human Resources Cluster Dr Mpilo Ngubane said youth were selected for the programme from a city database.

“We advertised for youth, who qualified, to register on a database to participate in such programmes. We renew and add new recipients to the database every three years,” he said.

This initiative is part of the Artisan Development Programme which was approved by council in 2016.

The target is to develop 10000 trained artisans in various trades. In the first phase of the programme, which ends next year, 500 beneficiaries were enrolled.
