DURBAN - “Alarm over expired food in Durban shops,” - the article in The Mercury (March 15) refers.
It is distressing to note that stores in Durban are selling contaminated/expired foodstuff, and items beyond the use-by date.

There is a big difference between the “sell-by”, “best before” and “use-by” date.
Some perishables can have their shelf life extended by deep-freezing, (as ships at sea do).
Has the food been tested for toxicity?

What is disturbing is that Isipingo is always mentioned, but how many traders have been successfully prosecuted there?
Also, such traders (including informal traders) should be publicly mentioned so that the scrupulous traders are not tarnished with the same brush.
Isipingo Rail would not have survived a day in business had it not been for the high business standards, good interpersonal relations and competitive streak of the pioneering business families.

More so in the face of ever-increasing consumer choices, competitors and options both within and beyond Isipingo.
This goes back generations.
Please name and shame the stores selling contaminated foodstuffs.
