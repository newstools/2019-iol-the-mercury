DURBAN - Police minister Bheki Cele is set to brief the media on reports of looming strike action by SAPS members at the  Gauteng SAPS Provincial Head Quarters in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday.
 In a statement issued by the minister of police today both Cele and the National Commissioner General Khehla Sitole will brief the media on social media reports that SAPS members are planning to embark on a 'strike action’.

 “The reports are purporting that SAPS members are apparently unhappy about the recent promotions and regrading process that benefited a "certain" category of members within the service,” read the statement.
 On Tuesday, The Star reported that thousands of police officers around the country have threatened to go on strike following a dispute over promotions.
 This is despite being classified as essential service staff.

Memoranda and voice messages shared on social media among officers highlighted the way police promotions have been handled.
In one instance it is alleged that the police's specialised units including the unit commonly known as Amaberete promoted constables to warrant officers while station members were left behind.
