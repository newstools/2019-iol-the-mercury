Durban - The Twitter community has launched a scathing attack on DA leader, Mmusi Maimane, after he challenged Kwaito star, Mampintsha, to take him on in three rounds of boxing.
The ¨challenge¨ made by Maimane was not accepted by South Africans on Twitter as users were outraged that he would want to use violence to solve the issue of abuse against women. 

The popular opinion was that they wanted Mampintsha to be locked up in prison.

On Monday morning, a video was released by Gqom singer, Bongekile 'Babes Wodumo' Simelane, via her personal Instagram account,  which showed a heated argument between the two. 
Simelane is then seen being assaulted by Mampintsha, real name Mandla Maphumulo and is then heard crying out in pain after he had hit her.

The recording sparked widespread outrage with many government officials and celebrities showing support for Simelane. She has since charged Maphumulo with assault. He has yet to be arrested and is believed to be in hiding.
