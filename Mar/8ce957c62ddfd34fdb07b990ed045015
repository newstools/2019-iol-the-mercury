DURBAN - The Department of Social Development has removed parental corporal punishment from the latest draft of the Children’s Third Amendment Bill.
This has left questions about whether the bill will be scrapped, or whether the department still feels strongly about criminalising the spanking of children.

The bill came after a high court judge found that a Joburg father had acted unconstitutionally when he spanked his son. In the October 2017 judgment, Judge Raylene Keightley ruled that spanking children was unconstitutional. 
Department spokesperson Lumka Oliphant said the matter was up for appeal in the Constitutional Court.
The Christian View Network moved quickly to “thank” the department for “scrapping” the ban.

“The latest draft of the bill, unlike previous versions which would have criminalised parents spanking children, makes no mention of ‘chastisement’ or ‘discipline’. It was previously proposed to be included in section 12,” said the network’s spokesperson, Philip Rosenthal.
“We argue that Judge Keightley grossly abused her power trying to use a case of physical abuse to ban reasonable parental physical discipline - and should be removed from the judiciary,” Rosenthal said.
