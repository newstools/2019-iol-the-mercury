Durban -  The Public Order Policing Units in KwaZulu-Natal had their hands full dealing with several protests on Thursday. 
 In Cato Manor, angry shack dwellers demanding land for housing and better service delivery blocked off Vusi Mzimela (Bellair) Road and King Cethwayo (Jan Smuts) Highway with rubble, glass bottles and tree branches and allegedly set alight a prefab building in Buro Crescent. 

 The Durban Fire department is on the scene extinguishing the fire while police dispersed protestors from the roads. 
 Several motorists are using the road but with caution as they have to navigate between rubble, refuse, trees and broken glass on the road surface. 
On Mary Thipe (Cato Manor) Road protestors demanding land to build homes had closed the road with rocks and tree branches early on Thursday morning. 

There was also protest action on the M5 on Otto Volek Road outside the business Mahle Behr in Pinetown. 
Several tyres were placed across the entrance driveway and set alight. 
 The KwaZulu-Natal Traffic alert group said protestors set alight tyres they placed on a bridge leaving Woodlands in Pietermaritzburg. The road had been closed and people living in the suburb could not leave the area until police intervened.
