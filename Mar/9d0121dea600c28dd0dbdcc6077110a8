DURBAN - The Msunduzi municipality has sent out a warning to service providers about fraudulent letters of appointment were circulated by a conman that requested suppliers to supply goods to the municipality.
The municipality said it became aware of two such letters recently, one dated just three days ago.

Some service providers arrived at the municipality demanding to know where they should deliver the “requested goods”.
The municipality said the scam artist approached businesses that had not tendered to supply goods and requested them to supply services with a promise of payment at a later date.
One letter, carrying the municipality’s logo and dated March 12, targeted a hardware store, requesting the store to supply the municipality with CLK traffic line paint.

The hardware store’s manager said he suspected something was amiss when he inspected the documents requesting that the store supply 20litre containers of paint.
“I noticed that the email on the documents was not one of the municipalitys,” he said.
He said after the store demanded payment before delivery, the conversation with the conman ended.

“When we insisted they pay before the paint is delivered the conversation did not go much further,” he said.
Msunduzi municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said two business owners had arrived at the municipality with the letters and asked when they should deliver the goods.
“The municipality inspected the letters and informed them that there was no tender,” she said.
