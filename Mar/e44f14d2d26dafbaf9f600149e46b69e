DURBAN - The National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) is urging Eskom to take note of its “grave concerns” for farm animals, that depend on electricity for survival, during scheduled load shedding.
Senior inspector Grace De Lange, manager of NSPCA’s Farm Animal Protection Unit, said the organisation had raised the matter with Eskom as early as December last year, but had only received requests for its meter number in return.

“We are disgusted by their lack of response and with the fact that they have clearly not even bothered to read our correspondence,” she said.
She said the council is “extremely worried” about the fate of thousands of animals that may suffer as a result of intermittent electricity deprivation.
The NSPCA said in any intensive farming system, animals are dependent on ideal environmental conditions to survive.

“Lighting, heating, ventilation, electric motors which run feed lines. Electricity is at the core of a productive intensive farming system,” it said.
The body said unfavourable conditions as a result of load shedding could lead to animals being stressed, having immune system failure, illnesses, or even result in death.
The power utility had not responded to enquiries by the time of publication.
