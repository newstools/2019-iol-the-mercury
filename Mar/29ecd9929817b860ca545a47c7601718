 Sboniso Petros Zwane appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court on charges of culpable homicide.

 

 He declined the media's request to photograph him saying that he did not want to put his children or family's lives in danger.

  blue shorts, he said he also feared for his own life.

 

 It is alleged that Zwane crashed into the school girls along Dumisani Makhaye Drive as they were walking to school.
