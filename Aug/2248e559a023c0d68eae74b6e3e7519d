Durban - A 31-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the death of an e-hailing driver, who was shot dead in Florida Road in June. 
The man appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court and has been remanded in police custody pending his next court appearance. Cedrick Musonera was shot dead following an argument at the KFC in Florida Road on June 18. 

Musonera, was employed as a delivery driver for an e-hailing food service. He had allegedly walked into the KFC in Florida Road and was accused of skipping the queue. 
According to Musonera's friend, Desire Kwizera, there were other clients behind him who were fetching their orders. Musonera's order was ready for collection and he went to inform the cashier at the till.
“As they were serving Cedric, the guy behind him asked the cashiers ‘why are they serving the monkey first?’ and that angered Cedric,” said Kwizera.

Kwizera said the man was escorted out of KFC by security and Musonera went to his motorbike.
He said while Musonera was at his motorbike, he was shot. Musonera was rushed to Addington Hospital where he died a short while later. 
According to a source, there have been no leads in the case as yet.
