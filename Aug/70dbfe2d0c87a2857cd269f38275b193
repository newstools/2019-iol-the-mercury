MEC Kwazi Mshengu has called the situation "disturbing".
"There's no space for racism in our schools. Clearly racism is deep rooted in the society we live in. We all need to fight it as a collective to defeat it. The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal will punish whoever is going to be found to have display this racist behavior," Mshengu said. 
On Wednesday afternoon, officials from the department were locked in a meeting with school management over the matter. 

Meanwhile, a teacher who allegedly told pupils at a Westville high school that "white people are genetically smarter than people of colour", has resigned. 
The teacher's resignation was confirmed by Westville Girls' High SGB chairperson, Steven Tait. He told the Daily News that the teacher had been suspended until August 12 however, the teacher has since handed a letter of resignation.
