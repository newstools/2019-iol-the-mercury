DURBAN - A massive 328-metre Korean-built container vessel, the MSC Aino, was christened at Durban harbour on Friday.
Her name, covered by a long Italian flag, was unveiled by Sandra Sarno, wife of Captain Salvatore Sarno, chairman of MSC South Africa on Friday.

The vessel was laden with containers for its maiden voyage to Europe, via Cape Town. It has the capacity to carry 12 100 containers.
With the launch came the announcement that, in November, the company will build a new passenger terminal, which would host an ocean training academy.
"It is intended that within five years this initiative will create 5 000 new jobs with an approximately $1 billion in salaries being brought back into the South African economy," Sarvano told a quayside gathering attended by provincial Premier Sihle Zikalala and Economic Development MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube. Also present was city manager Sipho Nzuza.

Acting Mayor Fawzia Peer was scheduled to attend but was not able to make it.
Sarno said it was anticipated that the academy will take on its first students in November, at its existing MSC building.
He said he had been on board the company's first "little" vessel when it arrived in Durban 50 years ago and berthed "just around the corner", starting a service to Europe that continues to function.

A band played South Africa's national anthem, "Nkosi sikelel' Afrika", as well as that of Italy, "Il Canto degli Italiani", before the proceedings.
