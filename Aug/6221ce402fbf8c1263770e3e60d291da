Durban -  Police officers attached to the King Cetshwayo Cluster in KwaZulu-Natal conducted raids for illegal firearms in Empangeni on Tuesday. 
Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KZN police spoksperson, said police proceeded to the Nseleni area where they identified a household that possessed illegal firearms. 

Police had been working closely with an informer network to eradicate crime in the area. 
Zwane said the house was searched and an unlicensed revolver as well as a replica gun were seized. 
"A 27-year-old man was arrested after he failed to produce a license to possess the firearm. He was detained and charged for possession of a firearm without a licence,"he said.

The police officers then proceeded to Ntambanana to following up on intelligence reports with regard to another unlicensed firearm. 
"An air-gun was found in the house and was seized by police. The arrested suspect will appear at the Empangeni Magistrates Court. Investigations are continuing to link the suspects and firearms to crimes committed in the province,"Zwane said.
