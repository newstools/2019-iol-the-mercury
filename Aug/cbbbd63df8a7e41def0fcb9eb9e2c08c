Durban - A man was treated for injuries sustained during an apparent drive-by shooting in Cowies Hill, in the Durban west area, on Thursday afternoon. 
 
 
  Blue Security's Andreas Mathios said reports of gunshots were circulated through various neighbourhood watch groups. 
 

 

 He said the occupants of the a white Mercedes Benz were travelling along a stretch of road when they came under fire. 

 

 "One of the occupants sustained moderate injuries. He was treated by paramedics at the scene. Multiple cartridges were found at the scene of the crime. The motive for the shooting is unknown at this stage," he said. 

 



 

 Mathios said traffic into Cowies Hill had been affected. 

 

 He said police had attended to the incident and were investigating further. 

 

 However, according to police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said no case had been opened. 

 

 It is alleged that the shooting is related to a murder that took place in Sydenham two weeks ago, where Chadley Thring was shot dead. 

 

 Thring had been standing outside a shop in Barns Road when he was gunned down. Several shots were fired and Chadley was declared dead at the scene. His funeral took place at Souls Outreach in Sydenham. 

 

 A case of murder is under investigation at Sydenham SAPS but police have yet to make an arrest.
