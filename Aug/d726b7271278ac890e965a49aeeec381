Durban - Hours after leaving the country intrigued on Monday by tweeting that "everything is falling apart" and the valley is vulnerable as it is facing the wind, former president Jacob Zuma threw another political jab. 
Unlike the previous tweet, which was littered with Zulu idioms that could not be easily decoded, Zuma was more straightforward.


 




Loosely translated, it means “Things are bad, the same people who came to power on the promise that they will fight corruption are now tainted by corruption and criminality. I wonder what will be the end result”. 

The tweet was interpreted in some quarters as a political jab aimed at reigning ANC and country President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is entangled in a CR17 donation leaked e-mail scandal that is threatening his presidency. 
As expected, the latest tweet by the former state president attracted differing views, with some calling him a bitter old man who should accept his grand scheme was defeated at Nasrec.
One Twitter user who identified as Farmer Andries (@AndriesOom) said Zuma was showing his true colours. 


 




While others felt that he was telling the truth and he should be left alone.

A Twitter user, Alpha B (@Green_Greenly) tweeting in Zulu, saying they all accused Zuma of corruption and now is their turn to face the same accusations.
