Durban - Police have arrested a man who allegedly pretended to be a police officer and proceeded to robbed a Phoenix family.
The man and his accomplices allegedly informed the occupants of the house that they were police officers. 

According to police, the armed gang ransacked the house making off with two TV sets, five cellphones, a sound system and other items including cash. 
"The family was also assaulted by the suspects," police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said. 
She said police investigated the incident and were able to trace the man to a house in Berghaven. 

"The suspect was positively identified by the complainant who was also present during the arrest. A search was conducted and numerous exhibits including cable ties and a gas gun were found in suspect’s possession," she said. 
Gwala said police investigations are continuing into the whereabouts of the rest of the gang and arrests are imminent.
"A 31-year-old suspect was placed under arrest.  He is due to appear in the Verulam Magistrates Court soon on charges of armed robbery. We are appealing to our communities to resist the temptation to buy stolen goods. The market for stolen goods is contributing to criminals committing further crimes. Citizens are urged to work with police to bring the perpetrators of crimes to book so that they can be placed behind the bars where they belong," she said.
