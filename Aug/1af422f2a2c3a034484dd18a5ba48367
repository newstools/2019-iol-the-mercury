Durban - The speaker of Okhahlamba Municipality in Bergville narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on Monday night.
ANC councillor Sthembiso Zulu was on his way home when he came under attack from gunmen who sprayed his official vehicle with bullets. Eleven shots were fired, but he escaped with only bruises.

Several attempts to speak to him yesterday were unsuccessful.
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of attempted murder had been opened at Ematsheni police station. 
The shooting comes after an IFP councillor, Mthembeni Majola, in Inkosi Langalibalele Municipality (Estcourt) was gunned down on Friday.

Okhahlamba mayor Mlungisi Ndlangisa said they were grateful Zulu had survived. 
“As a council and on behalf of the entire municipality, we are thankful there were no injuries and that the speaker remained unharmed. 
“I would like to urge the police to take swift action in investigating this matter,” Ndlangisa said . 

Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) MEC Sipho Hlomuka condemned the assassination attempt, saying the recent spate of violence directed at public representatives in municipalities needed to stop.
He said violence against councillors was becoming a disturbing trend that required urgent attention.
