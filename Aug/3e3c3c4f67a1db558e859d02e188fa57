Cape Town - Former
  ANC MP Vytjie Mentor has slammed President Cyril Ramaphosa's 
 administration, saying his promised new dawn was shaking and 
 crumbling.

 

 In a post on her Facebook page, Mentor said Ramaphosa had badly 
 mishandled DA leader Mmusi Maimane's question on the R500 000 donation 
 from controversial facilities management company Bosasa, now called 
 African Global Operations.

 

 "As a result, the president is forever in court like it was the case 
 under (former president Jacob) Zuma," she wrote, questioning 
 Ramaphosa's legal bill.

 

 Mentor, who joined the African Christian Democratic Party, also took a 
 swipe at Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, claiming she was 
 committing administrative errors in her rush to deal with Ramaphosa. 
 "She glaringly ignores facilitators, enablers as well as beneficiaries 
 of state capture," she said.

 

 According to Mentor, the courts have been plunged into a position 
 where they deal with matters that should have been avoided through 
 good governance, leadership and adherence to the law and 
 administrative processes.

 



 She said the country was crying out for a saviour and its leaders were 
 seemingly oblivious to the imminent disaster about to befall it.
