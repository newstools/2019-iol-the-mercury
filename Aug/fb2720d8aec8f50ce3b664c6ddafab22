"All the arrested suspects were placed before various courts in the province to answer to their charges. Police seized various quantities of drugs such as heroin, dagga, cocaine, mandrax, whoonga and crack cocaine. All the drugs will be forwarded to our Forensic Science Laboratory for further analysis as well as to be presented as evidence before our courts,"Zwane said.
