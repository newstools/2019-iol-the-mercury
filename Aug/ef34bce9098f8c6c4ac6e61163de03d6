Durban - Police have arrested four men and confiscated firearms after gunshots were fired during the funeral of a taxi boss in the Ilembe district at the weekend. 
The men, aged between 24 and 44, were arrested for discharging firearms in a public area. 

Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said police had been deployed to the sports grounds in Mthuli to monitor funeral proceedings. 
“Police heard gunshots at the funeral service and immediately responded leading to the arrest of four suspects. One of the men was arrested for possession of an unlicensed firearm,” she said. 
Mbele said the men are due to appear in the Maphumulo Magistrates Court.

All seized firearms will be subjected to ballistic testing to determine whether they were used in any other offences.
Earlier this month, two men were arrested for shooting into the air at the memorial service of slain Kasi Boys towing owner, Nkosi Makhaye. Residents reported having heard between 15 - 25 shots being fired at the grounds. 
There was a heavy police presence at the memorial and officers managed to nab the two men. They were taken to the Mayville police station for further processing. More shots were fired as the procession dispersed from the grounds and made their way to Thula Crest Road where Makhaye was killed.
