Durban - An intelligence driven operation by police led to 12 men being arrested at a panel beating business in Clairwood on Sunday.
“Police officers followed up on intelligence about a suspected stolen vehicle being at a local panel beating shop in Clairwood. 

“They raided the premises and a stolen vehicle, which was being stripped by the suspects, was seized,” said Zwane.
Zwane said the 12 men failed to provide police officers with a satisfactory explanation about how they came into being in possession of the vehicle. 
Police said the vehicle was stolen in Isipingo last month. 

“All 12 suspects were charged for being in possession of property suspected of being stolen,” Zwane added.
It is alleged that the men were stripping the car to resell the parts, but Zwane added that the investigation was ongoing.
“We are still investigating the incident and whether the men were working in a syndicate,” he said.

The men will appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court today.
Zwane urged the public to be wary when buying any item.
“Whenever you buy goods, you must verify where it comes from and ask the necessary questions before buying it,” he said.
