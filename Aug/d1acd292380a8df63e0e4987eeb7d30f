Durban - Search and Rescue teams have continued their search for a man who is presumed to have drowned at Wedge Beach, located to the right of Durban beachfront's new pier at the weekend.
 Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said it is alleged that on Sunday a group of men were playing soccer on the beach when a 29-year-old went for a swim and disappeared below the surface.

 “The search was suspended due to poor light and will continue in the morning[Monday],” said Zwane. 
 Andre Fletcher the Durban National Sea Rescue Institute(NSRI) station commander said the man is believed to be from Soweto.
He said NSRI Durban duty crew and eThekwini Lifesaving lifeguards were activated following reports from eThekwini Metro Police Search and Rescue of a drowning in progress.

 “An NSRI rescue swimmer responded directly to the scene to join eThekwini lifeguards who had initiated a search using a lifeguard jet ski and the NSRI rescue swimmer entered the water, conducting free dive search efforts,” said Fletcher.
 Fletcher said eyewitnesses reported that the man disappeared underwater.
 “Despite an extensive sea and shoreline search, there was no sign of the man,” he said.

 eThekwini Metro Police Search and Rescue and the SA Police Services, supported by lifeguards, will continue in an ongoing search operation.
 Police have opened an investigation into the incident.
