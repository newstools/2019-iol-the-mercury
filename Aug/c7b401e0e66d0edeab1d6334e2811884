Durban - A 32-year-old woman who was bitten by a scorpion in Trenance Park Verulam was hospitalised on Sunday.  

 

 According to Prem Balram from Reaction Unit SA the woman had been laying in bed when the incident occurred. 

 

 "At approximately 09:26 the Reaction Unit South Africa Verulam Operations Center received a call for medical assistance for the woman.
