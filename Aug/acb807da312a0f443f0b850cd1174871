Durban - Phoenix triple murder accused Colin Pillay claimed he had no memory of the days leading up to the murder of Phoenix mother Jane Govindasamy and her daughters. 

 

 Cellphone records showed that there was no communication between Pillay and Jane between the period of September 14 until September 19. 

 

 Under cross examination by 
 State Advocate Cheryl Naidu as to why there was no communication, Pillay said he simply could not remember. 

 
  
 
 
  He attributed his loss of memory to being held in custody at Westville Prison for almost a year. 
 
 
  
 
 
  "Long, time can't be expected to remember," said Pillay. 
 

 

 He said it was possible Jane was sick or they had had an argument. 

 

 Tuesday is the second that Pillay, 46, a tow truck driver, is in the witness box. 

 

 He has pleaded not guilty to three charges of murder and theft. 

 

  Jane, 45, a receptionist, her daughters Denisha, 22, and Nikita, 16, were found murdered at their flat in Longbury, Phoenix on September 20, 2018.

 

 The court heard that on September 19, 2018, Nikita sent Pillay a message at 6.05pm saying:"Mummy, asking if you can take me for tuition?" 

 

 The only communication between Jane and Pillay was two hours later when she asked if he had fetched Nikita. 

 

 The trial is in its fourth week.
