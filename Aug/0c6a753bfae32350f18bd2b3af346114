Durban - Police have arrested two brothers who were in possession of a stolen and a hijacked vehicle in Verulam, north of Durban. 
The brothers whose names have not yet been released to the media appeared in the Verulam Magistrates Court on Monday. 

Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said Police officers from Verulam SAPS were conducting crime prevention duties at their police precinct when they received information of a hijacked vehicle in the area. 
"The police officers proceeded to Cornubia where they spotted the vehicle. A check on the vehicle revealed that it was hijacked at Amanzimtoti in July. Police then proceeded to a local radio station to speak to the driver of the vehicle. The 29-year-old driver was traced and he was arrested for being in possession of a suspected stolen vehicle,"Zwane said.
He allegedly led police to his 27-year-old brother in the Ottawa area near Verulam. 

"His brother was found driving a vehicle which did not have a licence disc and was driven with false registration plates. After police had conducted an inspection on the vehicle, they discovered that the vehicle was reported stolen at Brighton Beach in July,"Zwane said.
He was arrested and charged for being in possession of a stolen vehicle. 
"He claimed that he bought the said vehicle from his friend for R5000. Both vehicles were seized for further investigation,"Zwane said. 

The outcome of their first court appearance was not known.
