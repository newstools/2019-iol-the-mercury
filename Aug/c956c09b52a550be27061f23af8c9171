DURBAN - Two people have been arrested for the brutal execution of a Greytown pensioner earlier this week.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said on August 5 at 2.10pm, 67-year-old Mqondeni Zondi was travelling on the D77 Ntembisweni Road from Greytown when his path was blocked by three armed suspects travelling in a vehicle. The suspects dragged him out of his vehicle and shot him in the head, killing him. They then set Zondi's bakkie and his belongings alight.

"His lifeless body was found by a farmer in Ntembisweni. Charges of murder and malicious damage to property were opened at Greytown SAPS," said Zwane.
"Greytown detectives arrested a 30-year-old suspect at Ntembisweni on Thursday. He was found in possession of a firearm and 18 rounds ammunition," said Zwane. "The recovered firearm will be subjected to ballistic tests to see if it is linked to other cases committed in the Greytown and surrounding areas."
He said the vehicle allegedly used in the commission of the offence was also seized from the suspect and was impounded for further investigation. 

Later a second 28-year-old suspect was also arrested at Makhabeleni in Kranskop for Zondi's murder.
