Durban - A 21-year-old man was set to appear in the Weenen Magistrate’s Court today for allegedly being in possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition, Brigadier Jay Naicker, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said.
Naicker said a multidisciplinary operation comprising various disciplines within the SAPS was conducted at Nhlawe in Weenen yesterday. 

He said during the operation, police officers confronted a heavily armed gang and the men resisted attempts to arrest them. 
A shoot-out ensued. 
“A 28-year-old suspect was fatally wounded during the exchange of gunfire while a 21-year-old suspect was placed under arrest. Police seized two AK 47 rifles, an R-5 rifle, an airgun and 101 rounds of ammunition at the scene.”

He said initial investigations indicated that the arrested suspect was linked to the murder of a policeman. 
On May 11, an off-duty police officer, Constable Nkosinathi Khumalo, 35, was shot dead in Estcourt. He was allegedly dragged out of his vehicle and his killers fled in his car. 
Naicker said the Hawks were investigating the murder. 

The Provincial Commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal, Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula, hailed the breakthrough into the killing of Constable Khumalo.
“These types of operation are going to be intensified so that we break this vicious cycle of serious and violent crime in KZN,” he said.
