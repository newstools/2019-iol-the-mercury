Durban - Acting Durban mayor, Fawzia Peer, has said the council and administration is still functioning in the city. 
Peer was commenting after councillors stormed out of an executive council meeting on Tuesday afternoon. 

"Members of the public can rest assured that service delivery has not been impeded or affected by the postponement of the Exco meeting," she said. 
Peer said executive members still acting in their respective portfolios until council processes are followed for them to be redeployed.
“The council and administration are still fully functional. In the past seven days, all the subcommittee scheduled meetings did take place. I would like to reassure residents that the transition does not have any negative impact on service delivery. We have scheduled a full council meeting on August 29 where I am sure decisions will be made. Redeployment is a process and we should allow the ANC space for them to make these decisions,” she said.

Earlier, the Daily News reported that the meeting did not go ahead as scheduled after opposition party councillors staged a walk out. 
According to the city's acting head of communications, Mandla Nsele, the meeting was thereafter postponed.
He said the ANC's Provincial Executive Committee is expected to announce who the incumbent members will, in due course.
