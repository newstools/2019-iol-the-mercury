Durban - The metro police officer who was spotted directing traffic in a pink outfit has been identified. 
 

 Spokesperson Parbhoo Sewpersadh said the policeman has been identified only as Mr Pillay and is stationed at the Beachfront SAPS. 

 

 Sewpersadh confirmed that the officer had been on crime prevention duties in the 
 Moses Mabhida Stadium precinct
  as there were two big matches. 

 

 "We had two big matches in Durban; the rugby and the soccer. During big match days we noticed that there is an increase in theft from motor vehicles and pickpockets. 

 

 "As part of crime prevention certain police officers dress in different clothes to fit in with civilians and keep a watch on would-be criminals. 

 

 "It doesn't make sense for them to use their police uniform. He said some officers even dress as vagrants."

 

 On Saturday the Metro Police officer had decided on the spur of the moment to help the traffic warden on duty in the area with the increased traffic volume. 

 

 "He just put on a reflector jacket and began directing traffic."

 

 He said the Metro Police would be counselling him in terms of his dress code.
