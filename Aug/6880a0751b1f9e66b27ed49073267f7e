Durban - The Democratic Alliance in eThekwini has welcomed the resignation of former Durban mayor, Zandile Gumede. 
Gumede officially resigned as mayor this week. 

"The DA has been instrumental in enforcing accountability in eThekwini and forcing the ANC’s hand to finally recall Gumede. However, it took the ANC far too long and the damage done to the municipality has been far too great," caucus leader, Nicole Graham, said. 
She said it was clear that the ANC acted when the pressure was too great to do anything else, and not out of the genuine need to see Gumede gone.
"Gumede was on paid leave as instructed by the ANC for three months, and continued to earn her R115 000 monthly salary. The municipality must now move to recover losses from Gumede and those who worked with her to loot eThekwini. The city’s Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption policy demands that this happens when people have been found guilty of wrongdoing. Resigning is not enough when hundreds of millions of rands, of public money, are involved," Graham said. 

She said they are now concentrating on the 62 councillors named in the court case as having worked with Gumede.

These councillors, Graham said, must be properly investigated, charged and held to account for what they have allegedly done. It’s untenable that almost a third of the Council has been involved in tender fraud.
