Durban - Two pupils had to be treated for smoke inhalation after a fire broke out at a Pietermaritzburg boarding school on Monday night.
Linpark High School principal Anash Mangalparsad said the two girls were doing well.

Mangalparsad said: “The students at the hostel were all having supper downstairs in the dining room when they had to evacuate the premises because they smelt something burning."
The principal said that one of the beds in the matric pupils’ dormitory had caught alight.
“The building is a three-storey building; the girls sleep on the first floor, the boys sleep on the second floor, and the ground floor is where the dining room is. The girls’ level was filled with smoke, so the girls had to sleep in one of the classrooms in the school,” he added.

Midlands Emergency Medical Services spokesperson, Derrick Banks, said paramedics arrived just after 5pm.
“The pupils were quickly evacuated from the building and accounted for. Two girls were treated for smoke inhalation and transported to a nearby hospital for further medical care,” said Banks.
Spokesperson for the Department of Education, Kwazi Mthethwa, urged students and teachers to be more careful.

“We understand that it was an accident but we do ask learners to be more careful when dealing with electrical appliances,” said Mthethwa.
Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the reason for the fire was still being investigated.
