Durban - Vigilant police officers thwarted the plans of two burglars who had just left with their stolen goods in the Durban Central area on Wednesday. 
Police officers were conducting crime prevention duties in the Central Business District to curb serious crimes and robberies said Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson.

While they were patrolling they spotted a group of men jumping into a vehicle and driving off.
"The police officers recognised that they may be involved in a crime. They chased the said vehicle and it was intercepted at Monty Naicker Street where it was searched. Five new cellphones and housebreaking implements including a crowbar and ropes were seized from the two occupants. The suspects aged 26 and 56, were charged for being in possession of property suspected to be stolen and housebreak-in implements,"Gwala said.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspects were linked to a break-in that was committed in the city where the cellphones were stolen. 

They are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court on Friday.
