In a separate incident, a man believed to be in his 50s died in a motor bike accident in the Bayhead Road area also on Monday morning.

 "Paramedics arrived on scene and found a male, believed to be in his 50s had sustained major, multiple injuries after his vehicle had collided with a truck. 
 "Despite advanced life support intervention and attempted resuscitation for over 30 minutes the mans injuries were too severe and unfortunately he was declared deceased on scene.
