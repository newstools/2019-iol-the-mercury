DURBAN - eThekwini Municipality has warned residents to avoid the water in the Inanda Dam.
This follows the pollution spillage at Willowton Oil in Pietermaritzburg, which has contaminated the Baynespruit and the Umsinduzi into which it flows.
eThekweni Municipality spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela confirmed that the pollution, containing caustic soda, had worked its way downstream into the Mngeni River and into Inanda Dam.
“Caustic soda is a very alkaline material and is therefore corrosive,” he said.
“Residents upstream of the dam and in the dam surroundings are advised not to expose themselves to the water in the river, nor should they allow livestock to drink such water until further notice.”
There were further reports that in the Msunduzi, cattle had been affected and dead fish had washed up. People had been warned not to gather them or eat them.
Shami Harichunder, spokesman for Umgeni Water, said a huge amount of water had been flushed down the Umsunduzi by way of a release from Henley Dam, on Wednesday and Thursday.
“The level dropped from 101 percent down to 65 percent but we are not yet sure if it has been effective.” 
He assured consumers that water passing through its treatment works would not be affected by the spillage.
"Umgeni water uses the most modern and advanced technology to treat water. It's a standard higher than what is required," said  Harichunder.

He said the utility did not expect any challenges and was monitoring water quality daily.
