Durban - EQUAL Education will be heading back to court tomorrow in a bid to have the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education and KZN SAPS Commissioner to apologise to them.
The group is demanding an apology after it said its protest had been shut down and its constitutional right to protest was denied two years ago.

In July 2017, a group of 30 people, including pupils from Nquthu, near Dundee, who were demanding school transport, gathered outside the department’s offices in Pietermaritzburg.
At the gathering, Equal Education said it had intended to publicly screen a short film called Long Walk to School.
According to Equal Education communications officer Jay-Dee Cyster, the protest was “unlawfully” shut down. 

“We complied with all the formalities in the Gatherings Act, and began to protest peacefully. 
“Despite this, we were approached by police officers and the Department of Education head of security, who challenged whether we had permission to gather,” said Cyster.
She said that on questioning the order to disperse, they were told that if they did not disperse, police officers would use tear gas on them.

In court papers filed last year representing both the department and the provincial police, the acting deputy director for risk management in the department, Andreas Shangase, denied Equal Education’s claims.
