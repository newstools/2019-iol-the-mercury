Durban - A Durban cop has found himself in a spot of trouble after his attempt to bribe a resident got him in handcuffs instead. 
The officer, aged 30, was arrested during an intelligence driven operation earlier this week. 

KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said on August 19, a resident crashed his vehicle and the police officer did not open a case. 
"He towed the vehicle and informed the vehicle owner to pay him R7000 in cash for him to release his vehicle. An operation was conducted immediately after this was brought to the attention of police and it led to the arrest of the police officer who will be charged for corruption. He was detained at the Durban Central police station. He has since appeared in court," Mbele said. 
She said two cellphones as well as cash that was handed over to him were seized by police. 

"The police constable was stationed at Durban North police station. The community is commended for bringing such corrupt practices to the attention of police so that such individuals can be brought to book. There is no place in the SAPS for corrupt police officers," she said.
