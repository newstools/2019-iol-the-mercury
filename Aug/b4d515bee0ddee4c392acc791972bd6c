Durban - An Inanda woman who allegedly hired a random man to kidnap a one-month-old baby has made her first appearance in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's Court. 
 

 Ntombisakile Nogidela, 28, faces a charge of kidnapping. 

 

 It is alleged that Nogidela had hired the man to kidnap a baby and offered to pay him R400. 

 

 She allegedly pointed out the house where the baby lived. 

 

 The man allegedly went to the house and told the parents about the kidnap plan. 

 

 It is alleged the parents together with the man hatched a plan to catch the woman red-handed. 

 

 They allegedly handed their baby over to the man who took the baby to Nogidela. 

 

 She apparently paid him the R400 and that it when he took the payment back to the parents and members of the community as proof. 

 

 Community members apparently approached the woman and found the baby on her bed in her home. 

 

 She was arrested and is remanded in police custody. 

 

 The suspect is expected to apply for bail next. 

 

 The State doesn't intend opposing bail.
