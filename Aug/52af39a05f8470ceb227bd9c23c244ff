Durban - The Delangokubona SA Business Forum gave back to the community, its leadership said. General secretary Thulani Myeza said when tenders were awarded to the forum, 5% of the proceeds went back to the community.
He said that during the recent floods, the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Gift of the Givers had approached the forum to help victims. “We also volunteered our time to hand out food parcels.” 

Delangokubona deputy secretary Sakhile Madonsela said the forum had implemented a My Spaza programme, involving informal community shops, which had worked with the chamber to buy groceries for flood victims. 
Myeza, also the managing director of Africom, said that while working on a project for Eskom he had identified three schools which needed assistance.
He said he approached Eskom on behalf of the schools to help with the donation of a computer laboratory for Siphapheme High School, two prefabricated classrooms for Sizophumelela High School and new toilets for Dumisa Primary School.

Eskom said the R639000 donation was part of its CSI programme.
Another programme Delangokubona would like to launch in future was a halfway house for prisoners re-entering society, Myeza said. He said the forum required two vacant buildings supplied by the government, to house released prisoners for about six months.
