Durban - Four people have died in separate incidents when fires ripped through informal settlements in Durban this past week.
There was a fire on Tuesday at the Dunston Gardens Settlement in Reservoir Hills, but no one was injured. On Sunday, a 60-year-old woman was killed in a fire at an informal settlement in Chatsworth, police confirmed. 

Last Thursday, a 17-year-old mother and her two children burnt to death when their shack caught fire at the Beachway informal settlement in Clermont.
EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said that disaster management staff had been notified about Tuesday’s incident and would undertake an assessment and co-ordinate a response.
“The initial assessment of damage indicated that 17 informal structures were completely burnt,” said Mayisela. 

“We have activated the supply of temporary relief and meals. The report has been forwarded to our Human Settlements Department for urgent intervention,” he said. 
He added that the South African Social Security Agency had also been notified via the same report. 
Due to a lack of space to erect a temporary marquee, the affected people were living with family and neighbours in the short term.

The municipality did not comment on the Chatsworth incident.
