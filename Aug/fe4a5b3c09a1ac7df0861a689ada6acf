Durban - The South African Weather Service said the rainy and cool weather conditions experienced yesterday in KwaZulu-Natal were likely to persist today.
Kevin Rae, a chief forecaster for Disaster Risk Reduction at the South African Weather Service, said the rainy weather would start clearing up between tomorrow and Friday.

“From mid-week onwards we can look forward to dry conditions with sunnier skies, accompanied by somewhat warmer conditions,” said Rae.
He said Friday would be the warmest day with sunny and warm conditions expected and a maximum temperature in the upper 20s. 
Rae warned that there would be a noticeable change at the weekend.

“A cold front is expected to brush past southern Africa on Saturday,” he said.
According to Rae, a dramatic drop in temperature is not expected over KZN in association with this cold front.
“Nor do we expect any severe or extreme weather at this stage, which should be good news for the general public,” he said.
