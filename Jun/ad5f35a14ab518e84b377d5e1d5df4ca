Durban - The eThekwini municipality says it’s looking to increase security measures to put a stop to vandalism of city infrastructure.
This comes after parts of uMlazi, south of Durban, were affected by water cuts that will continue today.

City spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the water department on Friday discovered that vandals had stolen air valves and ballostops.
“Due to vandalism ‘on an industrial scale’, the municipality was left with no option but to shut down lines supplying the township in order to replace numerous air valves and ballostops that were stolen,” said Mayisela.
He said that this had resulted in water levels in uMlazi’s reservoirs dropping substantially.

“As a result, many parts of the township will (today) be without water while reservoirs are filling up.”
Mayisela said the city apologised to the community for the inconvenience.
 “EThekwini is working unceasingly to return the situation to normalcy by tomorrow evening. Water tankers will be made available during water shedding,” he said. 

He urged the public to report anyone who was in possession of the municipality’s stolen property.
Meanwhile, Hammarsdale residents said they had not had water for the past two weeks. 
Resident Nokuthula Ndlovu said the municipality had not provided any update on when the water supply would resume. 

“We’re not being told anything about why this is happening and when it’s going to end. We’ve contacted the municipality and the ward councillor about this but there is no resolution.”
She urged the municipality to resolve the water issue before the schools reopen.
Mayisela apologised to the community and said that the water department had managed to fix the problem and the water supply would be restored.
