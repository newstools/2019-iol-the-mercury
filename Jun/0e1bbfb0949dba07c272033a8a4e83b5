Durban - Determined to better her community, Melissa Saville of Wentworth put on a pair of cleaning gloves and set out to clean up her street.
She is one of many young people who are refusing to be classified as “the lost generation” by getting involved in programmes that empower her community.

“I put up a post on social media asking people to join me in cleaning up our ward. The clean-up was done through my programme for young people called ‘Activate! Change Drivers’.
“I initiated the clean-up day in our area because I had noticed the trash piling up,” she said. 
She said a group of 27 people, armed with a positive attitude, black bags, boots and brooms, had come out.

Saville said she wanted to take it a step further by co-ordinating monthly clean-up operations. 
“I believe the numbers will grow after people see that we are putting in the effort and notice the change. I believe that people’s positive attitudes will come from clean environments,” she said.
Saville believes that young people should not wait for incentives or programmes led by government.

“We are well able to create and effect change in our communities. I hope that my programme encourages other young people to take responsibility for their areas,” Saville said.
