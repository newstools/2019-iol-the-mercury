Durban - Umbilo SAPS is investigating a case of murder after a woman's body was recovered from a canal at the weekend. 
Police and Metro Search and Rescue officers were called to retrieve the body of the 26-year-old woman from the Umbilo canal along the M7, near the Rossburgh Licencing Office. 

It is believed that the woman's body was found two days after she had gone missing from the informal settlement not far from the canal. 

 

According to officials, the body was retrieved from the river, using a rescue Stokes basket and a rope rescue pulley system.
The body was then handed over to Umbilo SAPS for further processing. 
Police confirmed that a murder docket had been opened. 

In a separate incident, officers were called out to a scene in KwaDukuza on the KZN north coast after the discovery of a shallow grave on Friday. 
Details around the find are sketchy but police have confirmed that the remains have been handed over for further testing to determine the cause of death.
