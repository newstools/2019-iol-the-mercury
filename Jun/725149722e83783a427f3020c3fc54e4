World famous South African DJ Black Coffee is being dragged on Twitter for allegedly "cheating" on his wife, Enhle Maphumulo. 

 

 The allegations started when French socialite and former wife of David Guetta, Cathy Guetta posted a video of her and Black Coffee exchanging multiple hugs at Cannes, France, where Coffee was playing.

 In the caption, Cathy called Black Coffee by his first name and stated how happy she was to see him again, referring to  “NATHI CATHY” which was rather too friendly according to Tweeps.

 Black Coffee and Enhle have not said anything about the allegations but Twitter "investigators" are adamant that the 'We dance Again' hit maker could actually be cheating on Enhle, since he has done it before.  

 


 
 


 However, others came in Black Coffee's defense, stating that Tweeps should mind their own business and that Cathy could just be a big fan.
