Durban - A 35-year-old man, accused of shooting a police officer at a car show in Wentworth, has been granted R2000 bail.
 

 Zane Saunders appeared briefly in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. He is accused of shooting Warrant Officer Jody Barrend Fenner following an altercation. 

 

 Fenner was shot several times and died enroute to Wentworth Hospital. A second person was also shot and is in a stable condition. 

 

 It is alleged that on Sunday evening, Fenner was with friends at a show hosted at Ogle Road grounds. According to witnesses at the scene Saunders and his friends began assaulting Fenner and the man he was with, while they were seated in Fenner's car.

 

 "When Jody saw that someone had pulled out a gun and more people were coming to the car, he fired two warning shots up into the air. He was then shot at, at close range," a witness said. 

 

 Saunders was arrested shortly after the shooting and charged with murder. 

 

 HAWKS KZN spokesperson, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, said 
 the case was postponed to August 14.
