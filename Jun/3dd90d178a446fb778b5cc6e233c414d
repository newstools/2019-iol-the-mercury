 Despite the heavy police presence at the funeral, no arrests have been made for the brazen firing of ammunition. There was a heavy police presence at the funeral. There were also private security guards at the church and cemetery.

 

 Periasamy, 30 has been linked to the notorious Bloods gang which have been operating in Phoenix for many years. He was recently released on R10 000 bail after he and his co-accused were nabbed for the murder of Enver Ramsamy in 2016. 

 

 Last year, Periasamy, his brother Kevin, and Kevin’s wife, Desiree, were arrested after a multi-disciplinary task team raised Kevin's home and found R97 156 in cash, two pistols, a shotgun, 64 live rounds of ammunition, 1 836 heroin caps, 138 heroin straws, 80 large crack cocaine pieces, 30 mandrax tablets, three bags cocaine, two Ecstasy pills and 186g of dagga.
