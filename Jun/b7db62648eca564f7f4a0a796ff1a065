Durban - Four men accused of killing two metro police officers in Bhambayi, near Phoenix, last month will remain behind bars pending further investigations.
Nkululeko Zuma, Musawenkosi Ndebele, Bonginkosi Msomi and Thamsanqa Mabaso appeared in the Verulam Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday.

The court heard that verification of their addresses was not conducted. 
Zuma, Ndebele and Msomi are accused of killing Inspector Zephinia Dladla and Constable Sonto Emmelinall Mhlanga in their police vehicle outside the home of councillor Moses Zulu. 
It is alleged that the men, accompanied by a fourth person, approached the officers vehicle and fired several shots. Dladla and Mhlanga died at the scene. 

Zulu was believed to have come out of his home and fired shots at the fleeing suspects but they managed to escape. 
The accused were arrested shortly after the murders. 
During their court appearance last week, the men claimed they had been assaulted while in custody at the Durban North police station holding cells. They requested to be sent to Westville Prison. 

The State has said it intended to oppose bail for the men. The case was adjourned to June 10.
