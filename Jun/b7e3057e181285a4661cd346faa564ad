Durban - A 31-year-old man has appeared in court for murder after he allegedly doused a man with petrol and set him alight.
The incident took place in Verulam last Thursday, allegedly after the victim was accused of stealing a grass-cutting machine.

The man died in hospital on Friday.
Reaction Unit SA spokesperson, Prem Balram, said the victim had sustained burn wounds to more than 90% of his body.
“When officers arrived in Parkgate, we found the man lying on the ground,” Balram said.

KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a man had been arrested for the attack. He was due back in court next week for a formal bail application.
She said a case of murder was being investigated by Verulam SAPS.
This incident mirrors that of slain former navy seaman, Seelan Pillay.

Last month, Pillay was allegedly kidnapped after he was accused of theft in Phoenix. 
Pillay was taken back to the place where he allegedly stole from and questioned. 
He was then doused with a flammable substance and set alight.

He was taken to hospital and died a short while later.
Five men, including two police officers, have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping and murder. 
Their application for bail was denied and they are due back in court next month.
