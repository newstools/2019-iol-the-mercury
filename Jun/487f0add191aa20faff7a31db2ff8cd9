Durban - An online campaign has been started to help Durban lensman, Daryl Kotze, get back on his feet. 
Kotze was shot multiple times in an apparent case of mistaken identity last month. Kotze had been driving along the N3 on his way home when he came under fire. 

No arrests have been made.

He suffered critical injuries and was in hospital for at least two weeks. 
He was recently discharged and is back home however, it will be another six to eight weeks before he is behind the camera again. 

Kotze's friend, Janus Horn, said a BackaBuddy campaign was stated and thus far more than R86 000 has been raised for the Kotze family. 
Kotze owns and runs his own company - Barcode Media - which also employs his wife and therefore supports his whole family. 
According to the page, Kotze is going to be unable to work for some time and if he is not working then there is no source of income for his family. His recovery period is anticipated to be six months.

"Funds are going into Daryl's wife's account to assist with living costs while he is man down," the page states.
