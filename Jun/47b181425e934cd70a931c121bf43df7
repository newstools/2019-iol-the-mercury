 Speculation is rife that the shooting was a hit on Periasamy following the death of another tow-truck driver earlier this year. 
 Periasamy was expected to stand trial along with six co-accused along with his brother Kevin Periasamy and sister-in-law Desiree in July.

 They were arrested and detained after police recovered R80 000 worth of drugs and over R90 000 cash in their home in January 2018.

 

 He was out on a bail of R10 000, after he appealed against a bail decision for a separate murder charge in February.
