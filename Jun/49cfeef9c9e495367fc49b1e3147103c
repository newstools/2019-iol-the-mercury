Durban - A 34-year-old man has landed himself in a spot of trouble after he was clocked travelling at 236km/hour in his VW Golf 6 on the N2 near Mandeni at the weekend. 
He faces charges of speeding, drinking and driving and failing to stop. The man was detained at the Gingindlovu Police Station and is due in court today.

KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda has commended the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) for the arrest.
“Earlier this year, we issued a clear directive to our law enforcement officers to clamp down on speeding, as well as drinking and driving. So far, I am pleased that our operations are yielding positive results,” said Kaunda. 
 He said the latest arrest will send a strong message to other road users that KwaZulu-Natal is a zero tolerance province.  

“Anyone who breaks the law in this province will spend time in jail. Therefore let us all abide by the rules of the road so that we can save lives,” said Kaunda.
