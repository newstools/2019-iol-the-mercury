Durban - Cellphone network providers, Vodacom and Cell C have rubbished claims that their agents are involved in a scam. 
Yesterday, a voice note did the rounds on social media claiming that there was a new scam in town. 

It is purported to be sent by a police officer. 
The voice note says; “People are standing at the shopping center and inform the public that they are Vodacom representative. They tell you that they are running a promotion and offering 5 gig data. They request the cell phone number and register the IMEI number."
It further states that funds can be withdrawn from a person's back account.

 Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, said that was impossible because the promoters will first have to have access to a person's internet banking to make payment. 
This was echoed by Cell C spokesperson, Candice Jones, who said the voice note was a scam. 
"What is claimed via the voice note is impossible but we will look into it," Jones said.

 Provincial police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, police were unaware of any cases.
