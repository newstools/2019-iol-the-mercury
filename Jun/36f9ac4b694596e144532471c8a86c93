Durban - It has been more than a month since it came to light that 62 eThekwini Municipality councillors allegedly benefited from tender kickbacks, yet to date no arrests have been carried out.
The allegations were made during the bail application for Durban Solid Waste (DSW) deputy head Robert Abbu, city supply chain deputy manager Sandile Ngcobo and municipal contractor Hlenga Sibisi in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court last month. 

The three face charges relating to fraud and corruption in a multimillion- rand tender deal with DSW. 
The State alleged when cross-examining Sibisi that substantial sums of money which had been received from the municipality for refuse removal had been transferred from Sibisiâ€™s business account to 62 city councillors and the Delangokubona Business Forum. 
Mayor Zandile Gumede is also an accused in the matter. 

Asked about the investigation, Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi, said he was not aware of an investigation into councillors at the municipality. 
City spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said it was also not aware of any investigation. 
DA caucus leader in eThekwini, Nicole Graham, said it was deeply concerning that the question was raised in court and no action had been taken. 

The matter is due back in court in August.
