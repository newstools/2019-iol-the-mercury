Durban - Five KwaZulu-Natal beauties are preparing to do battle against counterparts from the rest of the country to see who will be crowned Miss SA. 
The Top 35 is an impressive and diverse group. Among them are law students and graduates, nature conservation graduates, a private banker, owners of a photography company and a pizza takeaway, humanities students and a parliamentary officer.

The semi-finalists come from around the country – Gauteng has 19 contenders (with nine from Pretoria) followed by the Western Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal with five; the Eastern Cape and Free State with two while Limpopo and the Northern Cape each have one entrant.
 For the next fortnight they will be out to impress this year's semi-finalist round of judges who are actress and motivational speaker Leandie du Randt; broadcaster and Miss South Africa 2015 Liesl Laurie; former runway model and casting director Andiswa Manxiwa; Miss South Africa 2010 Bokang Montjane-Tshabalala and Women’s Health editor Danielle Weakley.
