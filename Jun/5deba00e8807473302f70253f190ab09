Durban - The body of an adult male was discovered at a container site in Umbilo on Wednesday morning. 
Police were called out to the scene just after 9am

According to officials at the scene, the gruesome discovery was made earlier in the morning by an employee in the yard. 

 


An officer at the scene said body had been lying in the drain for at least four days. It was in an advanced state of decomposition.


 



"The area around where the body was found is quite unstable. While we cannot make conclusions now, we suspect that the person was walking by when he slipped in and fell," the officer said.
 Police believe the deceased could have been searching for scrap metal in the yard when he fell into the drain.

SAPS and Metro Search and Rescue teams managed to climb down into the drain and retrieve the body. 

 




It was then pulled to the service for further processing. 
The body will be taken to the Gale Street Mortuary where a post mortem will be conducted to establish the cause of death.
