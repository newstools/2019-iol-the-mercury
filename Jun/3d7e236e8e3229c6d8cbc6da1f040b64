Durban - PHARMACIES are being urged to step up security following a spate of robberies around the city this week. Staff and customers of at least four pharmacies in the Durban CBD were targeted by criminals in a matter of days. 
eThekwini Secure’s Zain Soosiwala, said they responded to two of the four robberies reported. 

“When we arrived, we were told that the suspects had walked into the pharmacy and took phones, personal belongings and an undisclosed amount of cash,” he said. 
Soosiwala said they have since set up a network between a number of pharmacies in Durban. 
“This is to maintain communication and inform each other of if any suspicious people are spotted inside a pharmacy,” he said. 

Soosiwala said it was impossible to ascertain if the robberies were committed in order to steal medication. 
He said in most of the robberies, it was cellphones and cash taken. 
While the names of the pharmacies are known to The Mercury, management from each of the businesses declined to comment. 

KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said they are appealing to the pharmacy owners to take extra precautions and improve their security measures to prevent such crime.
“The police have also increased visibility and patrols around Durban to prevent such cases,” said Zwane.
