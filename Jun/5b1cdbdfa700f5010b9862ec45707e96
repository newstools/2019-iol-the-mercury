Durban - The Port of Durban, operated by Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA), has once again scooped the prestigious title of Africa’s Leading Cruise Port at the World Travel Awards. The Africa & Indian Ocean gala awards ceremony took place at Sugar Beach, Mauritius at the weekend where Durban won in three categories - Leading City Destination, Leading Meetings and Conference Destination and Leading Cruise Port. The awards were presented by South African media personality, Jo-Anne Strauss.
 
 
  This year’s awards once again saw the port up against strong contenders including Kenya’s Port of Mombasa, 
  Tanzania’s Ports of Dar Es Salaam and Zanzibar, as well as South Africa’s Ports of Cape Town and Port 
  Elizabeth.
 
 
  
 
 
  The Port of Durban previously held the title from 2010 to 2013 before losing it to Cape Town in 2014 and then 
  to Mombasa from 2015 to 2017.
 
 
  
 
 
  “We’re thrilled to have retained this respected title and 
  we must thank South Africans for so eagerly making cruise voyages a part of their lifestyle. Our thanks also go 
  the cruise line operators that continue to show such confidence in our port by including it on their itineraries, 
  often with multiple vessels calling to our sunny shores, said 
  Acting Durban Port Manager, Nokuzola Nkowane.
 
 
  
 
 
  Nkowane also expressed gratitude to 
  all the players in the local tourism sector who offer shore excursions and 
  cultural experiences to make the city of Durban such an attractive tourism destination.
 
 
  
 
 
  "They work constantly, 
  ensuring our continued 
  appeal to domestic and international tourists alike," Nkowane said. 
 
 
  
 
 
  The Port of Durban’s 2018/19 cruise season show passenger figures as having increased by 29.4% over the 
  previous year, according to TNPA’s recently released data.
 
 
  
 
 
  TNPA processed 255 422 passenger embarkations and disembarkations at the port, up from the 197 382 
  recorded in 2017/18. The port enjoyed 63 calls by 16 different cruise vessels. 
 
 
  
 
 
  To develop the port’s cruise sector facilities even further, the KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (KCT) consortium was 
  awarded a 25-year concession to develop a new cruise terminal and is presently finalising the detailed design 
  ahead of an anticipated commissioning date of 2020.
 
 
  
 
 
  Durban is presently used as a home port by MSC Cruises, which will introduce its MSC ORCHESTRA vessel on 
  the route in the 2019/20 season, following success with MSC SINFONIA and MSC MUSICA over the last few 
  years.
 
 
  
 
 
  Nkowane also congratulated Silversea Cruises, which was named Africa’s Leading Cruise Line 2019. 
  Headquartered in Monaco, the company has become a regular to local cruise ports, usually with two or three 
  vessels sailing locally per cruise season, including Silver Discoverer, Silver Whisper, Silver Spirit and Silver 
  Cloud.
 
 
  
 
 
  Founded in 1993, the World Travel Awards seek to acknowledge, reward and celebrate excellence across all 
  sectors of the global travel and tourism industry.
