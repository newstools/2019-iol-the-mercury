Durban - The police raided shops in Victoria Street Market in the Durban CBD yesterday afternoon.
Officers from SAPS Visible Policing, Tactical Response Team, Public Order Policing Unit and metro police raided stores searching for counterfeit goods in the Bertha Mkhize (Victoria) Street market. 

Branded and unbranded goods including shoes, jackets, tracksuit pants and bags were confiscated by the officers from the shops, that are owned by foreign nationals.
Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the operation was initiated by the crime intelligence unit. She said police had obtained a search warrant and the raid was part of a larger ongoing operation.
“The fake goods recovered include Nike products and adidas goods, including shoes, bags, pants and tops.”

Mbele added that the police were still going to investigate how the goods were shipped to the country. 
“We can’t be certain about where these brands are originated, but I can confirm that they aren’t original.”
She said those arrested would be charged with possession of counterfeit goods. “We’re also going to work with the Home Affairs Department to verify the documents of the foreigners, and those found to be in the country illegally will be arrested,” she said.

The confiscated goods were estimated to have a street value of between R20million and R25m.
