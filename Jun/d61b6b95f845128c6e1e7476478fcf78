Durban - 
 EMOTIONS ran high as hundreds of friends and family attended the funeral of Phoenix taxi and tow truck boss Kalvin Periasamy on Saturday held at Pesco Hall in Phoenix.

 

 The alleged leader of the Bloods Gang, was gunned down and died in the parking lot after leaving the gym at Gateway Theatre of Shopping on Thursday.

 

 His red and white casket arrived with a motorcade of vehicles to the sounds of bagpipes and crowd of mournful onlookers. During the funeral service, a seemingly never ending line of funeral goers paid their final respects. To the left of the hall a video slide showcased pictures of Periasamy with his family, wife and children.

 

 Accompanied by words which stated how he had a “reserved character, brilliant mind and family man” and how he was “gone from sight but not from their heart”.

 

 Periasamy was set to stand trial with his brother Kevin, sister-in-law Desiree and four other co-accused in July.

 

 They were arrested and detained after police recovered drugs and over R90 000 cash in their home during a raid in January last year.

 

 He was out on a bail of R10 000, after he appealed against a bail decision for a separate murder charge in February.

 

 Periasamy's widow Jearldine and his daughters sobbed as they entered the funeral venue. They sobbed again at his coffin.
