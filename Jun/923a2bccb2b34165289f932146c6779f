Durban - The Natal Sharks Board has confirmed that the sardines are on their way!

 

 The Board's Greg Thompson said they received confirmed reports of sardine-related activity between the Nqabara River Mouth and the Dwesa Marine Reserve. 

 

 It was reported that there 
 were large shoals of fish spotted with thousands of gannets feeding in amongst these shoals.

 

 "
 We also received a report late on Wednesday afternoon of activity in the Rame Heads area which 
 is 26 km South of Port St Johns. This activity consisted of common dolphins and gannets 
 feeding in this area. 

 

 "There have been no further sightings of much activity north of this but hopefully the sardine 
 activity will increase between Port St Johns and Port Edward after the cold front passes later 
 this evening. Please keep in mind that most of the reporting and feedback we are receiving is 
 in the inshore areas, so as we all know there is always a possibility of being surprised by fish 
 which have moved through undetected in the deeper waters," Thompson said. 

 

 He said sardines
  are very unpredictable and have always kept people guessing about their movement.

 

 "
 There are always numerous opinions but one seldom guesses right when it comes to sardines. 
 It is probably just as well otherwise the sardine stocks might have been non-existent by now. 
 The KZNSB will continue to monitor activity in the days ahead," he said.
