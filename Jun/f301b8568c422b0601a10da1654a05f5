OPINION - I was saddened to read that the Chetty family were denied entry to Mali’s Indian Restaurant in Durban for a pre-booked Father’s Day lunch because Mrs Chetty’s guide dog, Eddie, accompanied her (The Mercury, June 18). 
 

 In the very nature of things, guide dogs are very well-trained and do not misbehave themselves in unfamiliar surroundings. 

 

 The restaurant manager is quoted as saying that Mrs Chetty was “ walking around normally without the dog so, in actual fact, they just wanted to be difficult.”
Well, Mrs Chetty is partially sighted and not completely blind, and many folk in her position do manage to walk around with a degree of confidence that astonishes those blessed with normal sight. 

And the suggestion that the family “just wanted to cause trouble”, at least in my view, should be treated with the contempt I feel it deserves. They were out to enjoy a Father’s Day lunch, for heaven’s sake!

That said, however, I also feel that if mention had been made of Eddie’s presence in the party when the booking was made, this unfortunate affair might have been avoided.

I scuttle about in a wheelchair and unfailingly ask “are you wheelchair-friendly?” when I plan to visit somewhere for the first time. Many places are not, and this simple question prevents problems arising in the first place.
