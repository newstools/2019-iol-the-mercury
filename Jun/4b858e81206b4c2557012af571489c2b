Durban - A commercial fisherman died when a 21-foot fishing ski-boat he was on capsized off Mtunzini shore near Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal, said the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI).
NSRI Richards Bay duty coxswain Norman Rautenbach said the boat capsized 1.5 nautical miles off-shore of Mtunzini main beach with six crew on board on Friday.

“It was initially suspected that two of six crew who were on the boat when it reportedly capsized were still missing and four crew were on the shore including one crew member, a 41-year-old local man, who was confirmed to be dead,” said Rautenbach.
It was later confirmed that the two men who were reported to be missing were both safe ashore.
IPSS Medical Rescue with the assistance of Lenmed helicopter emergency medical service rescued the two men.

“A rescue swimmer was dropped from Lenmed helicopter near the capsized vessel. Two of the crew were flown to an awaiting IPSS Medical Rescue ambulance,” said IPSS spokesperson Paul Herbst.
