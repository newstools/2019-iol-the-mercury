JOHANNESBURG - Some of South Africa's First National Bank (FNB) customers had something happen to them that most people dream of, money mysteriously appearing in their accounts. 
 

 The bank said an error meant balances had been reflected incorrectly in some accounts.

 

 FNB said, "We can confirm that the issue of incorrect balances on some of our customers’ transactional accounts have been resolved. The incorrect balances were due to delayed debit card transactions for purchases. Sincere apologies to impacted customers for the inconvenience caused. Customers who have specific queries on their accounts can contact their bankers, or 087 575 9404 for Personal Banking, or 087 736 2247 for Business Banking."

FNB adjusted peoples money in error. They reverse this error then charge for the reversal of their own error. Now to "correct" the error of the error, the victim must contact the perp at their own cost. You can't make this shit up😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

This is not the first time this FNB thing is happening. My mom says it once happened with the Department of Education employees that got payed through FNB. Instead of 24K, people got 240K salaries. Abantu benza imisebenzi, bought cars, renovated houses etc.
