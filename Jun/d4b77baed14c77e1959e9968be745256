Durban - Shailendran Sukhraj, the 
 father of slain nine-year-old Sadia Sukhraj, took the stand in the Durban High Court on Tuesday where made an emotional statement during sentencing proceedings. 

 

 Holding back tears, the Chatsworth pastor said his daughter was "one in a million, and a million in one".

 

 He said his daughter was smart, a straight A student, mature beyond her years and could make friends easily with people. 

 

 Sukhraj
  said they had received counselling and the doctor told them that in all his 40 years of experience, the doctor had not come across a child as bright as Sadia.

 

 When asked by state prosecutor advocate Kelvin Singh, what sentence he should get, Shailendran without sentence said: "Maximum sentence." 

 

 He said the judgment had lifted a huge burden off their shoulders. Said the incident has brought him and his wife together, but there were days where it was painful for them. 

 

 When asked by Judge Esther Steyn the financial impact this had on the family. He said they did not pay attention to that and all they were focused on was Sadia.

 Defence advocate Sizwe Masondo had no questions for Shailendran.

 

 Nine-year-old Sadia died in a botched hijacking last year. The incident elicited public outrage.

 

 Mkhize was convicted on Monday for the murder of Sadia Sukhra. He was unemotional when he was convicted for murder and robbery. Sadia's death was one of the most high profile cases last year and it galvanised the Chatsworth community to protest against crime.
