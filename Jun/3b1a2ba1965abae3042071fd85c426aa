Durban - eThekwini Municipality has apologised to residents living in uMlazi, south of Durban, following a disruption in the collection of refuse. 

 

 City spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, said they are 
 in discussions with the main contractor responsible for refuse collection in the area to resolve a labour dispute with its workers with speed.

 He said a
 s a temporary measure, the city has made available 21 trucks to collect refuse. 

 

 "There are incidents where some of the city’s trucks were prevented from collecting garbage and the municipality has since asked the Metro Police to escort its trucks to accomplish this essential service. We are 
 appealing to the law enforcement agencies to apprehend anyone interfering with the freedom of movement on any citizen," Mayisela said.
