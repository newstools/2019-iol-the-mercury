Durban - PAY TV service provider MultiChoice is hoping to arrest the decline in the number of premium package subscribers by upping their current offerings.
According to their annual results, for the period ending March 31, Multi- Choice noted more people were choosing to cancel their subscription for other cheaper alternatives. 

The company has recorded a decline in the number of premium subscribers for a third consecutive year, despite a price freeze this year.
Currently, people subscribed to the premium package have to pay R809 a month, excluding the complementary R95 access fee. 
Lower priced bouquets range from R29 to R509 a month. 

According to MultiChoice chief executive Tim Jacobs, subscribers were tired of having to pay R809 for the service and still be charged R95 for the PVR function. 
He said the affordability of the package was a problem as many consumers were under pressure. 
Jacobs said MultiChoice was looking at enhancing their online streaming services, including Showmax, which now offered live sports. 

Comedian and radio DJ Neil Green said he only kept his premium subscription because of his love of sport, more especially English football.
“If there was a legal alternative to stream football, I’d cancel in a heartbeat. I do also have Netflix and I watch that most of the time,” he said.
