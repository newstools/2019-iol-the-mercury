Durban - The National Prosecutions Authority have welcomed the two life term sentences handed down to the man accused of murdering Chatsworth girl, Sadia Sukhraj. 
Spokesperson for the NPA in KwaZulu-Natal, Natasha Kara, said they hoped that the ruling would send a stern message to other criminals. 

"We welcome the conviction and sentence in the matter. We hope that it serves as a necessary deterrent. We are hopeful that sentences of this nature restore the public's confidence in the NPA that we are doing our best to curb crime, especially violent crime," she said. 


 
    



Sibonelo Mkhize was convicted in the Durban High Court, on a count of robbery with aggravating circumstances and two counts of murder on Monday. 
On Wednesday, Judge Esther Steyn sentenced Mkhize to 15 years imprisonment for robbery and a life sentence for each count of murder. 
Mkhize, 39, was arrested last year after he and an accomplice, Siyabonga Bulose hijacked Sadia's father, Shailendra Sukhraj's vehicle. 

Sukhraj fired several shots at the vehicle, which then crashed down an embankment.
