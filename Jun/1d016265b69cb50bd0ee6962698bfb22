Durban - Angry Cato Crest shack dwellers claim the police demolished their shacks on Saturday night and they were forced to sleep outside in the cold.
Yesterday morning the shack dwellers from an area called KwaDeda’Slingo, Cato Crest in Mayville marched to Independent Media’s office in Greyville seeking help.

Zinhle Dlamini, speaking for KwaDeda’ Slingo residents, said police claimed that they had a court order to demolish their shacks but the officers did not produce it.
Dlamini said they built their shacks on the land because they had been told by “leadership” that they could build in open spaces in February.
“We are not fighting, we are only trying to get places we can call home,” she said.

But Durban Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said the shack dwellers had built on land they had invaded. “They don’t have permission to build their shacks in that area and they have no respect for police.”
He said if they continued building the shacks the police would continue to demolish them.
Ward councillor Mkhipheni Ngiba said there was no “leadership” who would allow people to grab land. “Those people are building their shacks in front of police and there is a court order against invading land in Cato Crest.”

Spokesperson for eThekwini municipality Msawakhe Mayisela said they were aware of the invasions and were doing everything in their power to build houses for needy people.
He said the city was in the process of buying land to build houses for people. “We are trying our level best to accommodate as many people as we can,” he said.
He added that the land invaders were breaking the law.
