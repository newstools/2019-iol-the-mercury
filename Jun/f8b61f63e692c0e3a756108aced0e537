Durban - FRIENDS of a police officer who was shot and killed at a car show at the weekend have described the 29-year-old as a “gentle and kind person”.
Jody Barrend Fenner, a warrant officer stationed in Pietermaritzburg, was at the Phansi Day event on Ogle Road grounds in Wentworth, Durban, on Sunday. 

According to a friend of Fenner, they were leaving the event when a scuffle ensued. 
“I had gone to fetch Jody’s car and he got in. He spun the car and as he stopped, this group of men rushed towards us. They began hitting us,” he said. 
The man, who declined to be named, said one of the men pulled out a gun and Jody got out of the car. He fired warning shots into the air. 

“The person who shot him walked towards him and fired shots at close range. Jody fell. I rushed to where he was and checked if he was still alive. 
“I started looking for his keys to take him to hospital but I was told that we must wait until the police arrive,” he said. 
“Another guy came out and told us that Jody was bleeding

“He offered to take Jody in his car, and we left.” 
Fenner died before they reached the hospital. 
Hawks provincial spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said a 35-year-old had been arrested and was due to appear in court today.
