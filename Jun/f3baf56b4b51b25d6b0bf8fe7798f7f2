Durban - Seven days ago, Burundian national Cedrick Musonera was shot after he was accused of skipping a queue at a food outlet in Florida Road. Seven days later, police have yet to make an arrest. 
 

 Musonera, was employed as a delivery driver for an e-hailing food service. He had allegedly walked into the KFC in Florida Road and was accused of skipping the queue. 

 

 According to Musonera's friend, 
  
 Desire Kwizera, t
 here were other clients behind him who were fetching their orders. 

 

 He told The Mercury that Musonera's order was ready for collection and he went to inform the cashier at the till.

 

 “As they were serving Cedric, the guy behind him asked the cashiers ‘why are they serving the monkey first?’ and that angered Cedric,” said Kwizera.

Kwizera said the man was escorted out of KFC by security and Musonera went to his motorbike.

He said while Musonera was at his motorbike, he was shot. Musonera was rushed to Addington Hospital where he died a short while later.
