Durban - Empowerment through the medium of dance is one of the fundamental principles on which Sho Dem Entertainment is built.
It was started by Sydenham dancer Lyndon Green. 

The idea was to find creative ways to get youngsters busy and away from a life of crime and drugs. 
Green said: “We believe in inspiring other people to pursue their dreams. We do what we do to motivate people and to ‘Sho Dem’ that it is possible. We strive to set an example to the people of our community and to be role models to the youth.” 
The hip hop group has won many awards. Last year, it progressed to the World of Dance KZN regional qualifiers and took part in the fresh off the streets dance competition. 

The group was once again thrust into the spotlight when a video by one of its dancers went viral on Instagram. 
Jonathan Jacobs can be seen dancing to Huku, by South African poet and rapper Sho Madjozi. 
Jacobs is part of the junior dance crew, and has been part of the group for the past two years. 

The video is still having a major effect on Jacobs after it was viewed more than 500000 times and shared by US stars Chris Brown and Jermaine Dupri.
