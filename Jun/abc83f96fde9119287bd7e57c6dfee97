Durban - The Msunduzi Municipality has denied allegations that its mayor, Themba Njilo, has resigned.
Rumours, which emerged on Tuesday night, and spread via WhatsApp messages yesterday claimed Njilo had handed in his resignation on Tuesday.

His absence from the council meeting yesterday served only to fuel speculation.
However, acting municipal spokesperson Ntobeko Ngcobo said the rumours were not true. 
“The municipality would like to advise members of the public that there is no truth to the rumours that Mayor Njilo has resigned.”

She said the mayor could not attend a full council meeting because he was on sick leave. Despite the council denial, several sources close to Njilo, however, said he has been looking to leave the position for some time.
The Mercury understands from at least one senior official close to the ANC, that the party in the region was looking to bring changes to the executive in Msunduzi. “He tried to resign recently but was talked out of it by the ANC. 
“I suspect this time around he did not want to send his resignation letter to the ANC in the council or region but instead to the province, and sent a sick note to the council.”

The source said Njilo felt under pressure to leave following the arrest of his bodyguard, accused of murder. 
The source said while the matter had nothing to do with him, Njilo had felt unsettled by the incident.
