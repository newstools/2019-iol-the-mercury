DURBAN - The man, gunned down while still seated inside his vehicle outside his Coedmore home, has been described as a "quiet and soft-spoken person".
 

 Speaking to The Mercury, a neighbour said Sanele Mbhele, lived alone on the property. She said he kept to himself. 

 

 "He was such a soft spoken person and even when he spoke, you would have to ask him to repeat himself. He was very gentle and kept to himself. He was always either at work or studying," she said. 

 

 The woman said she had been living in the area for the last three months and was on her way home when she got a phone call about something happening near her home. 

 

 "My neighbour sent a voice note saying something was happening. I was with my kids in the car at the time. A few seconds later, she sent another message saying we should call the police," she said. 

 

 She said when she got to the scene, neighbours had managed to pull Mbhele out of his vehicle and were trying to resuscitate him. 

 

 Rescue Care's Garrith Jamieson said Advanced Life Support Paramedics took over resuscitation efforts.

 "However they were unsuccessful and the man was declared deceased on the scene. He had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to his upper body," he said. 

 

 Police have confirmed that they are investigating a case of murder.
