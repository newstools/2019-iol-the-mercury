DURBAN - The dispute that led to the municipal workers strike in the eThekwini municipality has been resolved.
This is according to a statement released by the municipality last night.

Workers from eThekwini’s water, sanitation and electricity departments downed tools two weeks ago, in protest against the upgrading of salaries for Umkhonto we Sizwe military veterans.
The strike led to refuse collection services being halted throughout the city and disruptions to the water supply in some areas.
The municipality said the dispute was discussed at the Bargaining Council by the SA Municipal Workers Union, Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union and the municipality, and was resolved amicably.

“It is good news that as from today (yesterday) employees will go back to work.
