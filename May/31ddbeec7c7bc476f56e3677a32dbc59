Durban - SEWAGE was still pouring into Durban’s bay through Lavender Creek yesterday afternoon, in spite of eThekwini Municipality saying it was not.
The Independent on Saturday smelt sewage and saw solid specimens. 

Point Yacht Club manager Darryl Williams said the flow was “cleaning slightly. But you can see faeces and sewage still coming down the waterways.”
Williams added that the water was going from brown to murky green. 
“Potentially, that's a good sign in terms of change,” he said.

The club's Anchorage Restaurant and Charlie's Bar remained closed and activities on hold.
eThekwini spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said on Friday morning that no sewage was coming through after the inflow of about 720000 litres an hour last week as a result of the Mahatma Gandhi Pump Station having broken down.
