Durban - The Vulindlela area, outside Pietermaritzburg, is hard hit by water shortages.
The area has, for the past few months, been affected by water shortages that has been lasting for days.

The Msunduzi municipality is responsible for water supply to the area. 
According to government study conducted more than five years ago, when it embarked on a process to build government housing,  the area was home to more than 25 000 household but has grown rapidly since then.
Residents in the area have to rely on supply by water tankers whose delivery is unreliable.  

IFP PR councillor in that area Thinasonke Ntombela said, “This has been going on for a long time. We suspect that the water are being deliberately turned off so they could be delivered with water tankers because someone is benefiting from the water tankers.”
Msunduzi mayor Themba Njilo said he recently met with residents and the matter was being addressed. 
Umgeni spokesperson Shami Harichunder said the problems partly related to the supply and demand issues, “We are supplying as much as we can but Vulindlela is a big area and it is growing.
