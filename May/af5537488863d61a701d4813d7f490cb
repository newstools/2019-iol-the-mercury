DURBAN - Among the special voters yesterday was former ward 71 councillor Sharon Hoosen, who cast her vote at Glenview Primary School in Chatsworth, Durban.
Hoosen, a mother of two, served as a ward councillor, chief whip of the DA and a member of eThekwini Municipality’s executive committee before she moved to the provincial legislature, to become an MPL. 

“I cast my vote and it made me proud to be a part of history. Many South Africans will use their vote to make the change that this country needs. Many of us voted in the historic 1994 elections, which inspired the nation and created hope for many South Africans. Twenty-five years later, we see the political landscape of our country has shifted,” Hoosen said. 
She is also the DA spokesperson on social development and sport and recreation in KwaZulu-Natal.
“The social development portfolio has been very active dealing with fraudulent Sassa (SA Social Security Agency) activities and migration of cards. I worked closely with NPOs and NGOs, who are so underfunded yet these organisations are expected to create a safe environment for women, children and the vulnerable.” 

Hoosen will oversee the elections today in the uMkhanyakude area, near Richards Bay, on the KZN north coast.
