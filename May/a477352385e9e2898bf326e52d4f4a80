DURBAN - Hundreds of residents living in Durban's wards 25 and 31, have signed a petition calling on the eThekwini Municipality to address issues on water and sanitation in their area. 
Ward 31 councillor, Chris Pappas, said they obtained signatures from residents living in affected areas

"Frequent water bursts, many of which in the same roads, are causing distress and unnecessary suffering in Overport. Numerous requests have been made to the head of Water and Sanitation to prioritise the maintenance and replacement of ageing infrastructure but these requests have all but been ignored," he said.
Pappas said three financial years have passed since councillors were elected and no budget allocation has been made to replace water infrastructure.  "Despite more than R600 million worth of water having been paid in the 2017/2018 financial year due to water loss it seems as if the city has no real solution or plan in place," he said. 
Pappas said they have given the city 14 days to respond.
