DURBAN - More than 700 residents voted at the Stonebridge Community Hall in Phoenix, Durban, before lunchtime on Wednesday. 

 

 The presiding electoral office at the voting station, Chris Mariemuthoo, said: “It has been crazy since the morning. There is a steady stream of people walking in. We expecting about 3 500 people to vote here today." He added that others, who did not reside in the area, still voted at the community hall. 

 

 Sandra Moodley, 51, said: “I chose to vote because I want a better future for the youth of this country. There are so many young men and women sitting at home or walking the streets because they have no jobs. I am also voting for a government that will impose harsher sentences on women abuse. It is so scary here. I hope my vote leads to the new government taking some sort of action.”

 

 Kishore Mahabeer, 52, said: “If there is no change, we will sit and cry. Nothing is happening. Our kids are not benefiting from anything. I believe someone needs to take a stand for the Indian community, especially the unemployed youth. Also, the roads in Durban are no longer safe. You cannot walk in town anymore. We just want a country where we feel safe."
