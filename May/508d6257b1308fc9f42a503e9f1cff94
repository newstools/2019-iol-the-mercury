Durban - Firefighters broke into one flat after another as a blaze swept through the ceiling of a block in Glenwood yesterday afternoon.
Neighbours in Craft Avenue, off Che Guevara Road, ushered residents out before the quick arrival of the fire brigade.

“I had been sitting in my office when I heard glass breaking,” said Naresh Maharaj, whose business is across the road from Sandyville Flats.
“People were screaming. I went across there and (with others) ushered everyone out.”
The fire is believed to have started in the fifth storey flat of Peter Kambaji, who went home in a hurry from his work in Umbilo, fearing for the safety of his children.

They had been evacuated, “but my daughter of 12 is traumatised”. 
He said he did not know where the family would stay, but hoped to be able to rely on the hospitality of friends.
The fire department’s divisional commissioner, Trevor Stevens, said it took the police an hour to get to the scene and they left soon afterward.

“Then some people were desperately trying to get back into a flat,” he said.
“I couldn’t stop them because there were no police. The fire brigade can only put out fires, we can’t police the public.” 
By the time of publication, police had not responded to requests for comment.
