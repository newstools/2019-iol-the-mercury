Durban - Former movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger was attacked by an unknown person during an event in Sandton on Saturday.
He was attending the Arnold Classic Africa Festival at the time of the attack. A video of the attack went viral on Saturday afternoon. 
In the video, Schwarzenegger is seen taking what appears to be a video selfie while a young athlete warms up. 
A man is seen attacking the former governor of California from the back with a flying kick. The attacker hits the floor, as the 71-year-old Schwarzenegger stumbles momentarily after contact. It is not clear why the man attacked¬†Schwarzenegger.¬†

The man was then apprehended.
On Twitter,¬†Schwarzenegger¬†said he was fine and only realised after seeing the video that he had been kicked. He was more concerned about his Snapchat being interrupted.
"Thanks for your concerns, but there is nothing to worry about. I thought I was just jostled by the crowd, which happens a lot. I only realized I was kicked when I saw the video like all of you. I'm just glad the idiot didn't interrupt my Snapchat," he said.
