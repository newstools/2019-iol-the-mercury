DURBAN - A Metro Police Constable was suspended after he was accused of raping a teenager in Welbedacht, near Chatsworth, at the weekend.
The officer, who cannot be named as he is yet to appear in court, was arrested by police at the weekend after the alleged incident. 

Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that the matter was under investigation. He added that, due to the accused being a police officer, it had been taken over by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). 
Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the officer was expected to appear in Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court today, on a charge of rape.
Head of Metro Police Commissioner Steve Middleton said they had received information from SAPS about the member being in custody and, as per their agreement with the Bargaining Council, the officer would be immediately suspended. 

“If the allegation is true, then we will take the necessary action against the officer. We will not condone any illegal actions by our members. If found guilty, then they must face the full might of the law,” he said.
