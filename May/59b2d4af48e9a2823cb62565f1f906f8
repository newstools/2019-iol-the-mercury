DURBAN - The body of a man was found in the Msundusi River near Commercial Road, Pietermaritzburg, after paramedics responded to a crash yesterday morning.
ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics had been alerted to an accident in which a vehicle had plunged into the river, killing one person and leaving five others injured.

“Paramedics found that a woman, believed to be in her twenties had already succumbed to her injuries. Nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead,” said Meiring.
He said the five other patients were assessed and found to have sustained moderate injuries.
“The patients were treated and thereafter transported to nearby hospitals for further care,” he said.

He said SAPS Search and Rescue officers who had responded to the crash found the body of a man approximately 10m away from the first incident. Meiring said ER24 paramedics found that the man had been dead for some time. 
Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the body had been found while authorities were pulling the vehicle out of the river.
Zwane said an inquest docket had been opened in connection with the man’s death.
