DURBAN - Three people have been arrested for pretending to be employees from the Department of Health. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, confirmed that a case of fraud has been opened against the two. 
"They approached a supermarket on Nelson Mandela Drive in Port Shepstone and proceeded to check the expiry dates of various items. They allegedly further requested the storekeeper to make a cash payment to them. The owner of the store then contacted the department to confirm the visit. This resulted in the three suspects fleeing in their vehicle," she said. 

She said the three suspects were arrested in Hibberdene on Monday, after they were spotted by vigilant members of the community. 
"A vehicle with false registration plates, reflective jackets, fraudulent documents from the Department of Health, identity cards as well as stamps found in suspect’s possession were seized. The vehicle used by the perpetrators was hired and fitted with fake department of health signage," she said.  
The suspects aged between 34 and 38 are expected to appear in the Port Shepstone Magistrates Court on Wednesday. 

"They face charges of extortion and fraud. We want to thank those that were vigilant and alerted police to these fake health inspectors," Mbele said.
