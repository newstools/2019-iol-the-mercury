DURBAN - Motorists travelling along the N2 and N3 can rest assured that there will be a smooth flow of traffic on election day. 
According to KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda, the KZN Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster (JCPS) has implemented tough measures and will be monitoring the busy routes for any truck blockades.

Kaunda was addressing the media at a briefing in Mayville, Durban, on Tuesday. 
"We view the ongoing threats by truck driver to disrupt elections in a serious light. We have initiated engagements with the National Prosecuting Authority and Department of Justice to attend to the cases of blockades speedily and impose harsh sentences," he said. 
Kaunda said government was doing all it could to address the issues raised by local truck drivers. He said for this reason, there is no need for further disruptions when the matter was being attended to. 

"This year alone, there have been several meetings between aggrieved drivers and government stakeholders," he said. 
In recent weeks, there have been several violent protests along the busy N3 route. Last month, three trucks were torched during protests at Mooi River and in the Midlands.
