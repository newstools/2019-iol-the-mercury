DURBAN - Protesters complaining about access to water and ablution facilities blocked traffic on the M4 highway by burning tyres at the Clairwood/Jacobs offramp yesterday[Sunday].
 Mpumelelo Zuma, the ward 32 Clairwood councillor said around 200 people from an informal settlement serviced by eThekwini Municipality protested over the relocation of a “stand water pipe.”

 He said the water pipe was centrally placed for 10 years but has now been relocated to the New York informal settlement in Archery Road.
"The people living at the new location of the pipe are depriving the others of using the water pipe,” he said.
 Zuma said the people want to know why the pipe was moved?

He said another issue is that some people are also being deprived of using the ablution facilities that are located in the New York settlement.
 “They are forced to relieve themselves in the bushes and are being attacked and robbed by vagrants,” said Zuma.
 Zuma said some people are being given preferential treatment while others are suffering.

 “Some people are being favoured by officials while some are being deprived and everyone should be getting the same treatment,” he said.
 He said five people were arrested and sustained several injuries to their faces, arms and legs.
Police did not respond to a request for comment.
