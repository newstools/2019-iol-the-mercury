DURBAN - Tsogo Sun employees in Durban took to the beach last weekend as they joined forces with thousands of volunteers, in a mass beach clean-up, following the devastating floods which hit KwaZulu-Natal last week.
The effects of the heavy rainfall saw, large stretches of the coastline around Durban littered with plastic waste and debris that washed down the Umgeni River.

Tsogo Sun responded to the plea for help from a social media campaign, spearheaded by Breathe Ocean Conservation – a non-profit organisation that aims to eliminate throw away plastic. The organisation called on locals to help clean up the shoreline.
Operations director, KZN hotels, Samantha Croft, said they were pleased to join the operation as they are committed to continuous environmental improvement initiatives. 
"Our staff are dedicated to assisting in such campaigns since it is very close to our hearts. By participating in this initiative, we know we have made a positive impact to our ocean,” she said. 

Croft said due to the major issues of plastic pollution both on and around these beaches, they believed it is their responsibility and support the mobilising of community, government and corporate entities within the area to become active citizens and engage in environmental protection and improvement activities.
