DURBAN - The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) has welcomed an news that an inquiry into varsity sex offences against both staff and students. 
The announcement was made by Minister Naledi Pandor. 

The union's Vuyo Mazwi said the Policy Framework announced by the Minister for Higher Education and Training was a major progressive step forward in eradicating the culture of gender-based harassment and violence in our lecture halls and campuses.
Mazwi, who sits at the union's NEC member for Social Justice, said workers in particular must feel that they are in safe environments to work in. 
"Those who seek to dehumanise others through acts of sexual harassment must know their days are numbered. NTEU won’t stand for it and we fully support the initiative by the Minister," Mazwi said. 

NTEU General Secretary, Grant Abbott, further highlighted that the union’s Policy Document on Sexual Harassment adopted at its 2011 National Congress equally acknowledges that students have the right to learn in an environment free from sex-based harassment. 
"We therefore urge all employees on all campuses to help create such a safe, learning-conducive environment," he said.
