DURBAN - Chaos erupted on the N2 at Port Shepstone yesterday after community members went on the rampage, barricading the freeway with rubble, bricks and soil.
The Bhobhoyi community closed the N2 between their rural town and Murchison, on the KZN South Coast.

Protesters ordered two tipper trucks to dump bricks and soil on the N2, making it inaccessible. The residents also threatened to continue protesting well into the night and this morning. 
By late yesterday afternoon, the road was still partially closed, with only a few cars being allowed to pass.
The violent protest is said to have been sparked by the lack of budget to fix D1014 district road that belongs to the Department of Transport. The road, which is in a state of disrepair and full of potholes, connects to the N2 and stretches for about 50km.

The community is demanding that the road be dug up and redone, but the department has been hamstrung by budgetary constraints and could repair only half the road.
Simon April from Ray Nkonyeni Municipality said residents were under the impression that R59million had been set aside for the road refurbishment project.
“When they met the officials from the department of transport last week, they were informed that only R29 million was available and they demanded to know what happened to the rest.”

Attempts to reach the Department of Transport were unsuccessful last night.
