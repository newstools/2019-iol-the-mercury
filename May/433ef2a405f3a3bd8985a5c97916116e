DURBAN - Three suspects who were arrested for the murder of two metro police officers made their first appearance at the Verulam Magistrate’s Court yesterday.
Musawenkosi Ndebele, 22, Bon- ginkosi Msomi, 20, and Thamsanqa Mabaso, 29, kept their heads lowered throughout the court proceedings. 

A fourth accused, Nkululeko Zuma, 19, did not appear yesterday as he is in Albert Luthuli Hospital after being injured during a shoot-out with the police.
The four suspects are facing two charges of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and conspiracy to commit robbery with aggravating circumstances.
The men were charged in connection with an incident last week in which metro police officers Sergeant Fanifami Dladla, 61, and his female colleague, Constable Sonto Mhlanga, 40, were killed. The two were shot dead while guarding the home of councillor Boxer Zulu in Bhambayi near Phoenix. The attackers took off with a police-­issued firearm.

The two officers were laid to rest at the weekend, with Dladla buried in Thongathi, Durban, and Mhlanga in Mpumalanga. 
The State asked that the suspects be kept in police custody as the police needed to verify their details. 
However, the accused’s attorneys, Mondli Mthethwa and Ivy Mukewa, told the court that their clients had complained that they were being abused at Durban North police station. The magistrate then ordered that the men be transferred to Westville Prison. 

The suspects will appear in court on June 3 to apply for bail.
