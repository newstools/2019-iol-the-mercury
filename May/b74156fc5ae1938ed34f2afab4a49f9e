DURBAN - The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) yesterday condemned the criminal targeting of the offices of Bayede News, ElaboHlanga and Ubukhozi newspapers in KwaZulu-Natal this past weekend.
Five armed men broke in and stole computers, cameras and office equipment. 

“This is a harsh blow to the news operation on the eve of the elections, and as a result they have not been able to print their latest publication.
“This not only impacts on media freedom at this critical juncture in the run-up to the elections but has a negative impact on the marginalised communities who rely on the newspapers for perspectives carried in their own language,” Sanef said. 
Sanef urged the police to make every effort to find the culprits involved and recover the equipment. 

“While this cowardly act is meant to put a spanner in our publishing works, it will not dissuade us from meaningfully engaging with our readership across all platforms in order to enable them to take informed decisions about their future far beyond the elections. 
“We are committed in ensuring that South Africans participate beyond the election,” editor Nhlanhla Mtaka said.
