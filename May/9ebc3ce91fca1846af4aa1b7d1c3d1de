DURBAN - The province of KwaZulu-Natal is ready to host the 2019 elections. 
 This is according to MEC for Safety Liaison in the province, Mxolisi Kaunda.

 

 He was speaking in his capacity of the chairperson of the KZN Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster at a media briefing on Tuesday morning.

 

 

 Kaunda said an assessment and classification of all 4884 voting stations has been done and he can assure all 5.5million registered voters in the province that they can go and exercise their democratic right to vote.

 

 He said a masterplan has been put into place which includes an ongoing intelligence assessment and categorisation of voting stations in terms of risks as well as security provision for political events and demonstrations.

 

 "There will also be a deployment of law enforcement officers to react to reported incidents and escorting ballot papers to voting stations," he said.
