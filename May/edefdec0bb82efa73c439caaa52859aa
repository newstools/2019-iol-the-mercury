Durban - Transnet has managed to stop the strike action planned by South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU) following a 48-hour notice for marine personnel to embark on a strike action on Wednesday. The strike action was stopped through a court interdict obtained by Transnet on Wednesday afternoon.
 The strike action was as a result of an unresolved dispute of mutual interest that exists between Transnet National Port Authority (TNPA) Marine Personnel who are members of SATAWU. The Marine Personnel include Marine Pilots, Tug Masters and Chief Marine Engineering Officers and are responsible for a large part of operations in the port system. 

TNPA remains committed in further engaging with SATAWU towards a resolution. 
“We would like to assure our customer and stakeholders of our commitment to provide a seamless service to the industry. TNPA management will be closely monitoring port operations and will try and prevent any potential disruptions to shipping movements," said Acting Chief Executive at TNPA, Nozipho Mdawe.
