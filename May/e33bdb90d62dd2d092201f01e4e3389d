DURBAN - Mthokozisi Pius Duze has been appointed chief executive of Mhlathuze Water, the utility announced yesterday.
Board chairperson Thabi Shange said: “After embarking on a rigorous selection process, we are pleased to announce Mthokozisi Pius Duze as the permanent chief executive of the utility.”

Shange said Duze had proved his mettle sufficiently at Mhlathuze Water when he held the dual roles of interim-chief executive and accounting authority - acting in the former position from 2016 and holding the latter from 2017 until the appointment of the current board in December last year.
“Duze has, over the course of his illustrious career in the government and its related entities, carved out a solid reputation for himself as a strategic leader boasting a vast understanding of organisational issues. 
"This, coupled with a sound understanding of governance and an ability to interact with stakeholders in all spheres - be they the public or private sectors - makes him an ideal appointment to take forward the strategic aspirations of Mhlathuze Water.” 

Prior to being seconded to Mhlathuze Water, Duze was attached to the KZN Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs as deputy director-general responsible for development and planning.
Duze has been involved in strategic service delivery programmes in KZN. He holds a Master's in Public Administration from UKZN and is currently doing a PhD in Water Security Studies with Kings College in the UK.
