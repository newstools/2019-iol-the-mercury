DURBAN - A nature conservation organisation received a boost of R350 000 when it was given an award for its elephant-protection work in Namibia’s Kunene region.
Accor, a world-leading augmented hospitality group, and Mantis, a South Africa-based hospitality and travel conglomerate, honoured the Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation (IRDNC) group with the Community Conservation Fund Africa (CCFA) Lab Award 2019 last week.

Mantis and Accor are both founding sponsors of the CCFA, which helps rural communities to engage in biodiversity-conservation through improved development of their land, wildlife and natural resources.
The CCFA award includes the donation of the R350000 to the IRDNC, which has outlined a four-pronged approach to protecting Kunene’s elephant population, which is considered a liability by some residents and farmers.
The donation will fund the following community-engagement initiatives: improve monitoring of the elephant population and its behaviour; resolve conflict over elephants to limit damage caused to farmers’ land and residential properties; and programmes and training designed to incentivise communities, to encourage them to help promote the economic potential of the elephants, which add significant value to Namibia’s tourism offering.

Accor chief executive Mark Willis said it co-founded the CCFA to implement community empowerment initiatives among communities living alongside wild animals, and encourage the communities to adopt sustainable management wildlife systems.
“The IRDNC’s project encapsulates all that we set out to achieve.”
