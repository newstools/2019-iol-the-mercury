Durban - The chance for voters in Bethani, Bergville, to cast their vote has come and gone, said Mawethu Mosery, the Provincial Commissioner of the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) in KwaZulu-Natal.
Mawethu Mosery said there was no remedy for those who missed the election. "They can look forward to the 2021 local government and the 2024 provincial and national elections."Â 

 Thousands of community members were unable to cast their votes following a community protest. They are demanding the removal of their councillor they accuse of defrauding the community out of their land claim settlement.
 The community blocked access to voting stations and in one station, only 20 people were able to vote out of almost 2000 registered voters.
Speaker of the Okhahlamba Municipality Sthembiso Zulu told The Mercury the protest had led to a very low voter turnout.

He conceded they they would have like the residents to get an opportunity to vote but said local leadership had no power to negotiate with the IEC and such advances they will leave to provincial and national leaders.
