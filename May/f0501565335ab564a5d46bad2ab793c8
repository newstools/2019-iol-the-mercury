DURBAN - The letter by Ramesh Sukdeo, “Desperate DA is spreading fake news”, The Mercury, April 29, begs a response.
Cyril Ramaphosa is deployed to government as president by the ANC. He therefore owes his allegiance to the party and not the Parliament or South Africans. 

I’m not sure what opinion polls Sukdeo is referring to, but all indications are that the ANC is in serious trouble. 
This accounts for the wooing of Malema by the secretary-general, Ace Magashule.
This is because there is a very real possibility that the ANC will need an alliance partner to govern after the elections. 

Malema rejected the ANC overtures as acts of desperation. 
The ANC’s leaders are implicated in all sorts of shenanigans where they have stolen from the public purse millions of rand. 
Ramaphosa himself is no saint. 

He lied to Parliament about his son’s dodgy deals with Bosasa, where it was initially thought that Ramaphosajnr only received R500000. 
Later we learnt that the amount was over R2million, part of which was used to fund Ramaphosa’s campaign to win his presidency of the ANC. 
Will Ramaphosa reveal the costs involved in his successful bid to become head honcho of the ruling party, and who are his funders? 

Speculation is rife that the cost was over R50million.
