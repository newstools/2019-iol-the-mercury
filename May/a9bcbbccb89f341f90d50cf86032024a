DURBAN - A 31-year-old police officer was killed while pursuing robbery suspects at a farm in Stellenbosch, Western Cape police said.
“Information was received on Wednesday that a house robbery was planned on a farm in the Stellenbosch area. 

The information was followed up by cluster detectives and Stellenbosch SAPS crime prevention unit. 
“The suspects were spotted during patrol and members pursued a suspect, and during a shooting incident, the police officer was fatally wounded,” said spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk yesterday.
The suspects managed to evade arrest and fled.

Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) spokesperson Moses Dlamini said unconfirmed reports had been received that the officer might have been shot by his colleagues.
“We are therefore conducting a preliminary investigation to determine if the discharge of police firearms resulted in any injury or death. If it is confirmed, the Ipid will take over the investigation. 
“The post mortem will be held (today) and will be attended by Ipid investigators,” Dlamini said.

The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) urged officers to act “decisively” when their lives were under threat.
Spokesperson Richard Mamabolo said: “Blatant attacks on police officers go beyond mere criminality and threaten the very foundations of our democracy, as communities are increasingly living in fear.”
