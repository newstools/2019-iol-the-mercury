DURBAN - The South African Army Infantry Formation (SAAIF) donated goods to Durban floods victims yesterday.
eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede received the donation at the City Hall. 

The SAAIF donated clothes, blankets, mattresses and perishable goods. 
After the devastating flood last month, the province was declared a disaster zone by the National Disaster Centre. 
At least 71 people lost their lives.

The general officer commanding of the SAAIF Major-General Rudzani Maphwanywa said they were shocked by the devastation caused by the flood.
“We felt it was our duty to rally around and get what we could to assist the victims,” said Maphwanywa.
Gumede said she was honoured to receive the donation on behalf of the residents. “During our visit to assess the damages, it was heartbreaking to witness residents who were left with nothing but the clothes on their backs.”
