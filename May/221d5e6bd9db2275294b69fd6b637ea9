Durban -  The African National Congress (ANC) in the eThekwini Region said on Tuesday that it "notes the appearance of the Regional Chairperson/Mayor Zandile Gumede and regional deputy secretary Mondli Mthembu this morning and the preferred charges against them by the Durban Commercial Court".
Gumede handed herself in to the Hawks earlier on Tuesday.

"We would like to reiterate our faith in the justice system and hope that this matter will be treated with respect and integrity it deserves," said the ANC.
The statement from the ANC Regional Executive Committee further added: "We subscribe to the principle of innocence until proven otherwise, which is a tenant of our juris prudence. We are a strong believer in the rule of law and the principles of natural justice. 
"However, we know that the court of public opinion doesn’t subscribe to these principles. We therefore urge everyone to respect the court as the only competent body to pronounce on its outcomes. 

"We are alive to the political and public implications of this process which is underway, we hope for a speedy resolution to this matter."
