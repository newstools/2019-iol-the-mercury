Pretoria - A livid Eersterust family is calling on the Department of Health to reprimand the Mamelodi Day Hospital.

 

 This after 76-year-old Martha Marais was allegedly tied to the benches of the waiting area. 

 

 Nursing staff at the Mamelodi Hospital allegedly tied her hands behind her back and to the metal chairs, forcing her on to the cold floor since Tuesday night.

  

 The family said the nursing staff ignored her, and opted to tie her up.

 

 Eyewitness said that Marais was showing signs of excruciating pain and screaming for the nurses to help.

 “She was pacing up and down. 

 

 "The old women was in pain,” said an eyewitness.

 

 Marias was referred by the Eersterust clinic to Mamelodi Day Hospital as she needed urgent medical attention.

 

 The hospital caters for patients from Mamelodi, Nellmapius, Eersterust, East Lynne, Cullinan, Pretoria East, Nkangala and Bronkhorstspruit.

 

 The Health Department is yet to comment on the questions posed by the Pretoria News. 

 

 This not the first time the hospital is in hot water. 

 

 In 2017 Reports of patients lying on the floor and in the storage rooms or sitting on casualty benches because of a lack of beds surfaced.
