  "The fire burnt through and spread into an office and reception area below. It was difficult to get into the place and there was no ventilation but firefighters managed to extinguish the fire,"he said. 
 
 
  
 
 
  The building was situated on Frobisher Place opposite the 
  Boscombe Terrace poll station. 
 
 
  
 
 
  The poll station was situated inside a tent. 
 
 
  
 
 
  Mike Bloxham, a local resident, said he could not breathe while placing his vote. He said voters were feeling uneasy because the wind blew the smoke towards the tent.
