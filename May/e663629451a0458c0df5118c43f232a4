 3578 people were registered to vote at this station

 'The problem is that they have to join another queue and fill in a section 24 form before they can vote but many are moaning.'

 

 Chetty said despite all hands on deck the crowds were picking up and it was difficult to control.

 

 Moorton resident Kishore Siv,54, said despite his disability he headed to the polls. 

 

 'Land grabs are a huge issue in Chatsworth and we are appealing to government to provide proper housing for people.'
