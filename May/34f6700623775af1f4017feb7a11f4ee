DURBAN - The minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha will officially open the newly built Estcourt Correctional Centre next week.
 Provincial Correctional Services spokesperson Thulani Mdluli said the Centre is a fully-fledged facility constructed to accommodate over 512 inmates.

 He said this facility is a much better improvement from the corrugated 203 bed-spaces structure which had to be demolished.
 “The centre is further capacitated with two housing units, cooks’ accommodation and single cell intensive care units,” said Mdluli.
 Mdluli explained that Estcourt Correctional Centre was built in line with the new prison generation models at a cost of around R387 million.

 “The Centre is meant to correct and rehabilitate inmates, which differs from the old prison system which pioneered punishment and warehousing of inmates,” he said.
 The Centre includes an education and vocational training centre, building maintenance workshop, central kitchen and accommodation units for officials.
 “The centre will bring much-needed relief to the challenges of overcrowding currently faced by Correctional Services, and fully adheres to the Government’s vision of promoting rehabilitation of inmates as means to end crime,” said Mdluli.
