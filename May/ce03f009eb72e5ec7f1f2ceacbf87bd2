DURBAN - Two memorial services will be held on Wednesday for late labour court Judge, Anton Steenkamp, who died after being bitten by a black mamba earlier this month. 
According to RSA Judiciary spokesperson, Nathi Mncube, the first service will be held at the Labout and Labour Appeal Court in Braamfontein. 

Mncube said the second service will take place on June 3 at the Labour Court in Cape Town. He said both courts will adjourn until 11:30am during the services.
Steenkamp and his wife, Catherine, had been on holiday in Zambia when the incident occurred. 
It is believed that Steenkamp passed away before the anti venom could be administered. 

Steenkamp was cremated in Zambia.
