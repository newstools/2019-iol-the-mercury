DURBAN - eThekwini Municipal deputy mayor, Fawzia Peer, has welcomed news that three suspects have been arrested in connection with the deaths of two Metro Police officers. 
 Peer said she was proud of the work that police had done. 

 

 I wish this case is dealt with 
 expeditiously and police remove murderers from our communities and put them where they 
 belong. I have said it before that killing a police officer is tantamount to high treason. People 
 who are doing that do not belong to our society but in prison. I hope our courts will send a 
 clear message to the would-be police killers that taking a life of a police officer and other 
 citizens in general, will not be tolerated in this country,” she said. 

 

 Inspector Zephinia Fanifami Dladla and Constable Sonto Emmelinall Mhlanga were gunned down while performing protection duties at the home on Councillor Moses Zulu. 

 

 Dladla and Mhlanga had been parked in a marked vehicle outside Zulu's home in Bhambayi, near Pheonix when they came under fire. Both died at the scene. Their firearms had also been stolen. 

 

 Following up on information, police were able to track down three men. 

 

 Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, confirmed that one of the men had sustained gunshot wounds and was in hospital. 
 According to a source, one of the firearms taken during the murders, had been recovered.
