CAPE TOWN -  About 37 utility chief executives from the African continent, including Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe, are expected to attend African Utility Week and POWERGEN Africa in Cape Town this month.
According to the organisers of the event, the CEOs will participate in the co-located Utility CEO Forum 2019, which is a closed boardroom meeting. CEOs will, however, also participate in joint activities and sessions with African Utility Week and POWERGEN Africa.
