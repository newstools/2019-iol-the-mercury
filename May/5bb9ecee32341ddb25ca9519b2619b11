Durban - Two people were killed in two-car crash on the R614 in Dalton in the early hours of Monday morning. 
ER24's Russel Meiring said the crash occurred just after midnight and emergency teams rushed to the scene. 

"The smoldering wreckage of one light motor vehicle was found on one side of the road while another light motor vehicle was found on the opposite side. On closer inspection, paramedics found a body lying in the wreckage of the burned light motor vehicle. Unfortunately, the patient had already succumbed to their injuries. Nothing more could be done by the emergency personnel," he said. 
Meiring said in the second vehicle, an elderly man was found lying trapped inside in a critical condition.
"ER24 medics extricated the man, began their treatment and immediately initiated advanced life support interventions. Unfortunately, after some time, the man succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead," he said. 

Meiring said the details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
At least 10 people died on KZN roads crashes at the weekend.
