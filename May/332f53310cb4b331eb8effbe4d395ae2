Cape Town - Hendrik Verwoerd's grandson will be making his way to Parliament. 
Dr Wynand Johannes Boshoff is the grandson of Verwoerd and will represent the Freedom Front Plus (VF-Plus) in Parliament, according to Netwerk24. 

Boshoff is the son of Orania founder and Northern Cape VF+ leader Professor Carel Boshoff. 
Hendrik Verwoerd  is often dubbed the "Architect of Apartheid" for his role in shaping the implementation of apartheid policy when he was minister of native affairs and then prime minister, once describing apartheid as a "policy of good neighbourliness".
Wynand was able to secure a seat in Parliament after the 2019 general elections. This was mainly in part due to the growth the VF-Plus received this election cycle. 

In the 2014 general elections, the VF+Plus obtained 165 715 national votes, but in this cycle the partly received 414 864 votes. 
According to the IEC, the party grew from 0.90% in 2014 to 2.38% in 2019.
