DURBAN - Political leaders in the Bethany area in Bergville are calling for calm after residents went on the rampage on Wednesday, blocking roads and preventing voting from taking place.
The community wants their ward councillor to be removed as they allege he had defrauded land claimants out of their settlements. 

The situation was calm yesterday. 
However, community members yesterday threatened that the protest could get worse after people were arrested for Wednesday’s unrest.
The community warned that the protest would continue until the councillor was removed from office.

Attempts to reach the councillor were unsuccessful yesterday. 
“We have asked the community to report the allegations they have made against the councillor to the law- enforcement agencies and allow them to investigate,” said the speaker of the Okhahlamba Municipality, Sthembiso Zulu. 
“We cannot just fire the councillor without him having being found guilty by a court of law. Only the department of Co-operative Governance and traditional affairs can remove a councillor if there is a reason - we as the municipality cannot do that.” 

Zulu confirmed that there had been “very low voter turnout” in the area. 
Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said eight suspects aged between 17 and 46 years were arrested during the protest. He said more police officers has been sent to the area and the situation was under control.
