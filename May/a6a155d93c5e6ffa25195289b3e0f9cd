DURBAN - Striking eThekwini Municipality workers, who are unhappy about salary upgrades for MK vets, have vowed not to vote on Wednesday.
“Their MK friends must go and vote. We are not going there,” said a worker. Striking workers from eThekwini’s water, sanitation and electricity departments downed tools two weeks ago. They are protesting against the upgrading of salaries for uMkhonto weSizwe military veterans.

The city said last week that it had decided to halt the upgrades.
SA Municipal Workers’ Union eThekwini regional chairperson Abraham Xulu said it would meet with the workers and a facilitator from the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration today.
The Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union vice-chairperson in the eThekwini region, Queen Mbatha, said no agreements were reached at Friday’s bargaining council meeting.

Mbatha said while no Imatu workers were on strike, the union was part of negotiations. 
City spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said they were waiting for the report from the central bargaining council. He said DSW was unable to provide refuse collection services. 
“Residents are requested to keep all refuse within their properties or to take it to the nearest landfill sites i.e. Mariannhill, Ilovu, and Buffelsdraai,” he said.
