DURBAN - Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the KwaMashu Hostel yesterday as voters prepared to make their mark in the country’s sixth democratic elections.
The area has been in the spotlight following a spate of political killings in recent months.

Voting at the station was delayed by more than 30 minutes, but this did not discourage the residents. Cele said it was important to observe the elections in the province’s hot spots, and said he was pleased there had been no incidents reported at the hostel.
“We expected long lines at this station. I am glad it is moving quickly and smoothly,” said Cele.
Voter Msizi Mseleku, 59, said he was delighted he could exercise his democratic right to vote. 

“I know my right. I even told my employer I was not going to work because I needed to vote. We have a lot of problems in our country. But if we do not vote, we cannot change anything,” said Mseleku. 
He urged Cele to increase police visibility in the hostel and around KwaMashu. 
“We do appreciate the visits by the minister during the election. But, the visibility must continue in the weeks and months to come.”
