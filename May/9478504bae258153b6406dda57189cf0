DURBAN - One man was killed and twenty-two others injured this morning when a truck overturned outside of Wartburg, KwaZulu Natal this morning.

 

 ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said personnel, along with other services, arrived on the scene at 07h34 to find a truck lying on its roof on the side of the road. 

 

 He said that the passengers that had been traveling on the back of the vehicle were found scattered around the scene.

 

 Meiring said emergency personnel assessed the patients and found that one man had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life.

 

 “Nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead on the scene. Twenty-two other patients were attended to on the scene. Two men were found to be in a critical condition while twenty others had sustained minor to moderate injuries,” said Meiring. 

 

 He said that paramedics treated the patients and provided the two critically injured with advanced life support interventions. 

 

 “Once treated, one of the critically injured patients was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg while the remaining patients were transported by ambulances to various hospitals,” he said.

 

 Meiring said it is believed that the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to roll and ejected the passengers off the back.
