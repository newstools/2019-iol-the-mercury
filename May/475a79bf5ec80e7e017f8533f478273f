Durban - A woman was killed and five others treated for injuries after the vehicle that they were travelling in, veered off the road and plunged into the Duzi River in Pietermaritzburg. 
ER24 spokesperson, Russel Meiring, said medics rushed to the scene just after 4am on Tuesday morning, near Commercial Road in Pietermaritzburg. 

"ER24 personnel found the SAPS Search and Rescue Services already in attendance. A light motor vehicle was found in the middle of the river, with three of the occupants seated on the banks. Search and Rescue Services and ER24 medics climbed into the river to retrieve the three other patients that had also been in the vehicle," Meiring said. 
He said once the vehicle was retrieved from the river, medics found that the woman, believed to be in her 20s, had already succumbed to her injuries. 
"Nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead. Five other patients were assessed and found to have sustained moderate injuries," he said. 

Meiring said the patients were treated and transported to nearby hospitals for further care. He said police are investigating further.
