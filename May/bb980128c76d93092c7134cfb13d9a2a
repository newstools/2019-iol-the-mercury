DURBAN - 
 Eleven school children were injured after the transport vehicle they were in collided into the back of a bakkie on the M19 between Blair Atholl and Mount Batten drive this morning.

 

 Derrick Banks said Meditech ER medics arrived on the scene and found both vehicles in the right-hand lane of the M19 with damage to both. 

 

 Banks said the school children were still in the transport vehicle when the paramedics arrived.  
 He said that the Meditech ER crew assessed the patients and found that the children ranging from age nine to fourteen had sustained minor to moderate injuries.

 

 “More vehicles were called to the scene before the injured was transported to various hospitals in the Pinetown area for further medical care,” said Banks. 

 

 He said it is believed that due to protest action on the M19, vehicles started to slow down causing the bakkie and transport vehicle to collide into one another. 

 

  
 “Authorities on the scene requested that we leave the area due to the protesters were making there way up the M19 and would not be safe,” he said.
