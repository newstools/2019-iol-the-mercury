DURBAN - For many, summiting Mount Kilimanjaro represents a milestone, a physical accomplishment and a reminder of the power of the human mind and body to accomplish remarkable feats of endurance.
This year it will mean much more for a group of women led by the former public protector, Professor Thuli Madonsela. The Thuli Madonsela Executive Climb, sponsored by LexisNexis SA, will address the battle many young girls face every day in South Africa. 

Madonsela will lead an expedition of influential women up Mount Kilimanjaro to raise enough funds for the Caring4Girls menstrual hygiene programme to ensure that girl children will not miss a day of school and will receive much-needed accessibility to sanitary pads. 
Scheduled to summit on Women’s Day, August 9, they will be the second of two summit groups in this year’s annual Trek4Mandela initiative. 
While Madonsela was unable to respond to questions yesterday, one of the women who will stand by her side throughout the journey is Durbanville resident Mari van Wyk.

“These young girls have many mountains to climb daily - the circumstances they live in, many don’t have regular meals each day, clothing, transport, etc - and to be without such a basic necessity as a sanitary pad when they enter womanhood is unthinkable,” said Van Wyk.
Individuals can make a pledge of R30 towards fund-raising by SMSing the name “MARI” to 42513.
