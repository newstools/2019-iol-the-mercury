DURBAN - A Durban father is recovering in hospital after he was shot multiple times on Thursday night.
Daryl Kotze had been on his way home after landing at King Shaka International Airport when his gold Toyota Fortuner came under fire. He had been in Gauteng to shoot a music video. 

At the time of the shooting he was travelling on the N3, near the Felix Dlamini Road turn-off. He was treated by paramedics and rushed to hospital in a critical condition. 
Manor Gardens Community Policing Forum chairman Janus Horn said he was unsure of the motive for the shooting. Horn said none of Kotze’s camera equipment had been taken. 
Kotze’s family said he was alert, but still traumatised. His wife, Trish, said he was on the road to recovery. 

“He is such a fighter and we are so proud of how he is hanging in there. He is very confused and does not remember anything from the past few days. The doctors are very positive about his recovery, and all we can do now is wait,” she said. 
She added that the family was overwhelmed at the outpouring of support and love for her husband. 
Kotze is well known in the entertainment industry and has shot music videos for the country’s top artists. 

Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said no arrests had been made.
