DURBAN - The sewage leak in the Durban harbour, that led to some port operations being suspended, has been contained. 
 

 Consultant for the city’s department of sanitation Dave Wilson said the pumps which had led to the leak had been repaired and were running perfectly.
He said the area around Lavender Creek, along the Durban esplanade, had been cleared. Wilson said due to the spring tide, the area was “cleaning itself”.

“We’ve cleaned up most of the affected areas and whatever is left will be dispersed with the spring tide current,” he said. 

He added that the teams would go out to the areas today to monitor the situation. 

City spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela confirmed that clean-up operations, which began last week, were going smoothly. He said all areas that were affected by the spill had been cleaned. 

The Mercury previously reported that sewage had been seeping into the harbour since last month, owing to the failure of a pump at the Mahatma Gandhi pump station. 

Diving operations and fishing in the Port of Durban remain suspended until further notice.
