DURBAN - As thousands of people made their way to voting stations in wards across the municipality on Wednesday morning, police had to use teargas to disperse a crowd of protesters gathered on Mary Thiphe Road in Cato Crest.
 

 Security personnel moved into the area just after 7am where they broke down several illegally erected structures in an open field along the road. 

 As officers tried to disperse the crowd, they were pelted with rocks and stones from those standing on a hill at a nearby informal settlement. 
 For weeks, Metro Police had been deployed to the area due to ongoing violent protests. 

 

 There were also reports of protests along the N2, northbound before the Higginson Highway and in uMgababa on the KZN south coast.
